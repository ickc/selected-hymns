Didst go alone.

Death had on Thee no claim,

Thou sinless One!

He who had death’s dread pow’r

Met Thee in that dark hour:

Vanquished by Thee his power,

By Thee alone.

2 But Thou hast burst the grave,

Risen art Thou;

Death could not Thee enslave,

Death had to bow!

Victorious hast Thou come

Out of the darksome tomb,

Broken the bands of gloom:

Beyond death now.

Thou didst achieve!

What fruitfulness doth God

From Thee receive!

Out of Thy death has sprung

A wondrous living throng:

All, all to Thee belong,

And in Thee live.

Lowly we bow;

Chief in Thy Father’s heart

Chief to us now.

Our great eternal theme,

Worthy of all esteem;

Worthy art Thou!

Glory round His wounded brow.

Who fought the fight alone;

Triumphant saints no honor claim,

His conquest was their own.

2 By weakness and defeat,

He won a glorious crown,

Trod all our foes beneath His feet,

By being trodden down.

3 He Satan’s power laid low;

Made sin, He sin o’erthrew,

Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,

And death by dying slew.

Slain in His victory;

Who lived, Who died, Who lives again,

For thee, His church, for thee!

Ascend, by Him, to Thee.

Shall match her glorious King,

And all the saints, the women,

E’en now incline thine ear:

And all thine own things here.

Thy beauty then shall blossom—

‘Twill be the King’s desire;

Are made of inwrought gold

Within the inner palace,

How wondrous to behold!

The glory of God’s nature

Is given her to wear,

That all His holy being

She may in life declare.

She’ll to the King be led,

In that fine linen garment

To be exhibited.

’Tis by the Spirit’s stitching

That Christ in us is wrought,

And with this glorious garment

We’ll to the King be brought.

When we the King shall see!

We’ll shout His worthy praises

Through all eternity.

And though the King we worship

Or glory in the Queen,

In all this blest enjoyment

The glory goes to Him.

O what is man that Thou should’st care

That Thou should’st mindful be?

The son of man Thou visitest

3 O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man,

The One who joined our race,

Who put upon Himself the flesh

And took a lower place.

But now with glory Thou art crowned,

With sovereignty complete.

Now through Thy Body Thou dost rule

With all beneath Thy feet.

Low at His footstool adoring we fall,

Seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;

Looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,

Tread we the billows as safe as on land.

Strong are the barriers that call us to halt;

March we on fearless, and down they must fall,

Vanquish’d by faith in Him far above all.

Theme of the ransomed’s song.

His people offer here;

Will reach the Savior’s ear.

To celebrate the Name

Of Him that sits upon the throne,

And to exalt the Lamb.

death has spoiled His foes.

He is parted from His friends;

While their eager eyes behold Him.

He who walked with God and pleased Him,

Preaching truth and doom to come.

To His home, to His home, to His

everlasting home.

With His blood, within the veil;

And the kings before Him quail;

Of His grace, of His grace,

double portion of His grace.

On the clouds to God’s right hand;

There we sit in heav’nly places,

There with Him in glory stand.

We by faith, we by faith, we by

faith behold our own.

Equal honors to the Son,

With every morning sacrifice,

3 People and realms of every tongue

Dwell on His love with sweetest song;

And infant voices shall proclaim

Their early blessings on His name.

4 Blessings abound where’er He reigns:

And princes throng to crown His head,

The weary find eternal rest,

And all the sons of want are blest.

5 Where He displays His healing power

Death and the curse are known no more;

In Him the tribes of Adam boast

More blessings than their father lost.

6 Let every creature rise and bring

Peculiar honors to our King;

Angels descend with songs again,

And earth repeat the loud Amen.

**132** 8.7.8.7.7.7. with chorus

1 Hark! Ten thousand heav’nly voices

Sound the note of praise above;

Jesus reigns and heav’n rejoices,

Jesus reigns, the God of love.

See, He sits on yonder throne;

Jesus rules the world alone.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen.

2 Sing how Jesus came from heaven,

How He bore the cross below,

How all power to Him is given,

How He reigns in glory now.

’Tis a great and endless theme—

Oh, ’tis sweet to sing of Him.

3 Jesus, hail! Thy glory brightens

All above and gives it worth;

Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens,

Cheers, and charms Thy saints on earth.

When we think of love like Thine,

Lord, we own it love divine.

4 King of glory, reign forever!

Thine ar, everlasting crown.

Nothing from Thy love shall sever

Those whom Thou hast made Thine own

Happy objects of Thy grace,

Destined to behold Thy face.

5 Savior, hasten Thine appearing:

Heav’n and earth shall pass away.

Bring, oh, bring the glorious day,

When, the awful summons hearing.

Then with raptured hearts we’ll sing.

“Glory, glory to our King!”

**133** 6.6.6.6.8.8.

1 Rejoice, the Lord is King,

Your Lord and Kind adore;

Mortals, give thanks and sing,

And triumph evermore:

Lift up your heart, lift up you voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

2 His kingdom cannot fail;

He rules o’er earth and heav’n;

The keys of death and hell

Are to our Jesus giv’n:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

3 Jesus, the Savior, reigns,

The God of truth and love:

When He had purged our stains,

He took His seat above:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

4 He sits at God’s right hand

Till all His foes submit,

And bow to His command,

And fall beneath His feet:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

**134** 8.7.8.7.7.7.

1 Lord, Thy love has sought and found us

Wand’ring in this desert wide;

Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us,

For us suffered, bled, and died.

Sing, my soul! He loved thee,

Jesus gave Himself for me.

2.  Hark! what sounds of bitter weeping

From yon lonesome garden sweep;

’Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,

While His followers sink in sleep.

Ah, my soul, He loved thee,

Yes, He gave Himself for me.

3 He is speaking to His Father,

Tasting deep that bitter cup,

Yet He takes it, willing rather

For our sakes to drink it up.

Oh, what love! He loved me!

Gave Himself, my soul, for thee.

4 Then that closing scene of anguish:

All God’s waves and billows roll

Over Him, there left to languish

On the cross, to save my soul.

Matchless love! how vast, how free,

Jesus gave Himself for me.

5 Hark again! His cries are waking

Echoes on dark Calvary’s hill;

God, my God, art Thou forsaking

Him who always did Thy will?

Ah, my soul! it was for thee,

Yes! He gave Himself for me.

6 Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,

Glad Thy suff ‘ring time is o’er;

To Thy Father’s throne ascended,

There Thou liv’st, to die no more.

Yes, my soul, He lives for thee,

He who gave Himself for me.

7 Lord, we worship and adore Thee

For Thy rich, Thy matchless grace:

Perfect soon in joy before Thee,

We shall see Thee face to face.

Yet e’en now our song shall be,

Jesus gave Himself for me.

**135** 8.6.8.8.6.

1 Eternal Love! Oh, mighty sea,

That hath not bounds, or shore,

I gaze upon Thy tideless waves,

I know the Love that loving saves,

I worship, and adore.

2 Eternal Love, Eternal Love,

That ever shall abide;

The Love that saves, the Love that keeps,

What vastness in Thy glorious deeps,

Oh ocean deep and wide!

3 Eternal Love that loveth me,

And loving, made me love,

That brought my Savior pain and loss,

The awful anguish of the Cross,

To lift my soul above!

4 Eternal Love that bore the curse,

That else must fall on me,

Now to the glory of Thy grace,

Mine eyes shall see the Savior’s face

Thru all Eternity.

5 Eternal Love, O Son of God,

Glorious in all Thy ways!

Thou art enthroned in light divine,

The light in which Thy saints shall shine

Thru everlasting days.

**136** 8.7.8.7.D.

1 Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;

Rolling as a mighty ocean,

In its fullness over me,

Underneath me, all around me,

Is the current of Thy love;

Leading onward, leading homeward,

To my glorious rest above.

2 Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Spread His praise form shore to shore;

How He loveth, ever loveth,

Changeth never, never more;

How He watcheth o’er His loved ones,

Died to call them all His own;

How for them He intercedeth,

Watcheth o’er them from the throne.

3 Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Love of every love the best;

’Tis an ocean vast of blessing,

’Tis a haven sweet of rest.

Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

‘Tis a heav’n of heav’ns to me;

And it lifts me up to glory,

For it lifts me up to Thee.

**137** 13.13.13.13. with chorus

1.  I stand all amazed at the

love Jesus offers me,

Confused at the grace that so

fully He proffers me;

I tremble to know that for

me He was crucified,

That for me, a sinner, He

suffered, He bled and died.

O it is wonderful that

He should care for me

Enough to die for me!

O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

2 I marvel that He would descend

from His throne divine

To rescue a soul so rebellious

and proud as mine;

That He should extend His great

love unto such as I,

Sufficient to own, to redeem,

and to justify.

3 I think of His side, pierced and

bleeding to pay the debt,

Such mercy, such love and

devotion can I forget?

No, no! I will praise and adore

at the mercy seat,

Until at the glorified throne

I kneel at His feet.

**138** 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1 I stand amazed in the presence

Of Jesus the Nazarene,

And wonder how He could love me,

A sinner condemned, unclean.

How marvelous! How wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

How Marvelous! How wonderful!

Is my Savior’s love for me!

2 For me it was in the garden,

He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”

He had no tears for His own griefs,

But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

3 In pity angels beheld Him,

And came from the world of light

To strengthen Him in the sorrows

He bore for my soul that night.

4 He took my sins and my sorrows,

He made them His very own;

He bore the burden to Calv’ry,

And suffered, and died alone.

5 When with the ransomed in glory

His face I at last shall see,

‘Twill be my joy through the ages

To sing of His love for me.

**139** 8.6.8.6.

1 O blessed Savior, is Thy love

So great! So full! So free!

Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,

Our lives, engaged with Thee.

2 We love Thee for the glorious worth

Which in Thyself we see;

We love Thee for that shameful cross,

Endured so patiently.

3 No man of greater love can boast

Than for His friend to die;

Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!

What love with Thine can vie?

4 Though in the very form of God,

With heav’nly glory crowned,

Thou didst a servant’s form assume,

Beset with sorrow round.

5 Thou wouldst like wretched man be made

In everything but sin,

That we as like Thee might become

As we unlike had been:

6 Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,

In every beauteous grace;

From glory unto glory changed,

Till we behold Thy face.

7 O Lord, we treasure in our hearts

The memory of Thy love;

And ever shall Thy name to us

A grateful odor prove.

**140** 8.8.8.8.4.4.8.8.

1 I have a Friend, whose faithful love

Is more than all the world to me:

‘Tis higher than the heights above,

And deeper than the soundless sea;

So old, so new, So strong, so true;

Before the earth received its frame,

He loved me—Blessed be His name!

2 He held the highest place above,

Adored by all the sons of flame,

Yet such His self-denying love,

He laid aside His crown and came

To seek the lost, And at the cost

Of heavenly rank and earthly fame

He sought me—Blessed be His name!

3 It was a lonely path He trod,

From every human soul apart;

Known only to Himself and God

Was all the grief that filled His heart,

Yet from the track He turned not back

Till where I lay in want and shame,

He found me—Blessed be His name!

4 Then dawned at last that day of dread,

When desolate, yet undismayed,

With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,

He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,

Was then made sin On Calvary,

And, dying there in grief and shame,

He saved me—Blessed be His name!

5 Long as I live my song shall tell

The wonders of His dying love;

And when at last I go to dwell

In that bright home with Him above,

My joy shall be His face to see,

And bowing there with loud acclaim

I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!

**141** 8.6.8.6.

1 Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?

O height, O depth of love!

Thou one with us on Calvary,

We one Thee above.

2 Such was Thy grace that for our sake

Thou didst from heaven come down,

With us of flesh and blood partake,

In all our misery one.

3 Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine

Confessed and home by Thee;

The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,

To set Thy members free.

4 Ascended now, in glory bright,

Head of the Church Thou art;

Nor life nor death, nor depth nor height,

Thy saints and Thee can part.

5 Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own

This wondrous mystery,

That Thou in heaven with us art one,

And we are one with Thee.

6 Soon, soon shall come that glorious day

When, seated on Thy throne,

Thou shalt to wondering worlds display

That Thou with us art one.

**142** 10.10.10.10.4.

1 It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine

Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,

Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,

Know more and more.

2 It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine

Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,

A love which can remove all guilty fear,

And love beget.

3 It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine

Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,

Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,

Nigh unto God.

4 But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know

The fulness of Thy love, while here below,

My empty vessel I may freely bring;

O Thou, who art of love the living spring,

My vessel fill.

5 I am an empty vessel—not one thought

Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;

Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,

With this the empty sinner’s only plea,

Thou lovest me.

6 Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!

Lead, lead me to the living fount above;

Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,

And never to another fountain fly,

But unto Thee.

7 Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,

When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,

Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,

Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,

My soul shall sing.

**143** 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1 Majestic sweetness sits enthroned

Upon the Savior’s brow;

His head with radiant glories crowned,

His lips with grace o’erflow.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2 No mortal can with Him compare

Among the sons of men;

Fairer is He than all the fair

That fill the heavenly train.

3 He saw me plunged in deep distress,

He flew to my relief;

For me He bore the shameful cross

And carried all my grief.

4 To God, the Father, my abode,

He brings my weary feet;

Shows me the glories of my God,

And makes my joys complete.

5 Since from His bounty I receive

Such proofs of love divine,

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

Lord, they should all be Thine.

**144** 8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6.

1 King of my life, I crown Thee now,

Thine shall the glory be;

Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,

Lead me to Calvary.

Lest I forget Gethsemane;

Lest I forget Thine agony;

Lest I forget Thy love for me,

Lead me to Calvary.

2 Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

Tenderly moumed and wept;

Angels in robes of light arrayed

Guarded Thee while Thou slept.

3 Let me like Mary, through the gloom,

Come with a gift to Thee;

Show to me now the empty tomb,

Lead me to Calvary.

4 May I be willing, Lord, to bear

Daily my cross for Thee;

Even Thy cup of grief to share,

Thou hast home all for me.

5 Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire

For all that know not Thee;

Then touch my lips with holy fire.

To speak of Calvary.

**145** 11.12.12.12.

1 With praise and thanksgiving there

stands a great throng

In the presence of Jesus and sing

this new song.

Unto Him Who hath lov’d us and

wash’d us from sin,

Unto Him be the glory forever!

Amen!

2 All these once were sinners,

defiled in His sight,

Now arrayed in pure garments, in

praise they unite.

3 He maketh the rebel a priest

and a king,

He hath bought us, and taught us

this new song to sing.

4 How helpless and hopeless

we sinners had been,

If He never had loved us till cleansed

from our sin.

5 Aloud in His praises our voices

shall ring,

So that others, believing, this new

song shall sing.

**146** 8.6.8.6.

1 O for a thousand tongues to sing

My great Redeemer’s praise,

The glories of my God and King,

The triumphs of His grace.

2 My gracious Master and my God,

Assist me to proclaim,

To spread through all the earth abroad,

The honors of Thy name.

3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,

That bids our sorrows cease;

’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,

’Tis life, and health, and peace.

4 His love my heart has captive made,

His captive would I be,

For He was bound, and scourged and died,

My captive soul to free.

5 He breaks the power of canceled sin,

He sets the prisoner free;

His blood can make the foulest clean;

His blood availed for me.

6 So now Thy blessed Name I love,

Thy will would e’er be mine.

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

My Lord, they all were Thine!

**147** 6.5.6.5.D.

1 Jesus, wondrous Savior!

Christ, of kings the King!

Angels fall before Thee,

Prostrate, worshipping;

Fairest they confess Thee

In the heav’n above.

We would sing Thee fairest

Here in hymns of love.

2 All earth’s flowing pleasures

Were a wintry sea;

Heav’n itself without Thee

Dark as night would be.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the light above.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the life of love.

3 Life is death, if severed

From Thy throbbing heart.

Death with life abundant

At Thy touch would start.

Worlds and men and angels

All consist in Thee,

Yet Thou earnest to us

In humility.

4 Jesus! all perfections

Rise and end in Thee;

Brightness of God’s glory

Thou, eternally.

Favored beyond measure

They Thy face who see;

May we, gracious Savior,

Share this ecstasy.

**148** 5.6.8.5.5.8.

1 Fairest Lord Jesus!

Ruler of all nature!

O Thou of God and man the Son!

Thee will I cherish,

Thee will I honor,

Thou, my soul’s glory, joy and crown!

2 Fair are the meadows,

Fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring;

Jesus is fairer,

Jesus is purer,

Who makes the woeful heart to sing!

3 Fair is the sunshine,

Fairer still the moonlight,

And all the twinkling starry host;

Jesus shines brighter,

Jesus shines purer,

Than all the angels heav’n can boast!

4 All fairest beauty,

Heavenly and earthly,

Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;

None can be nearer,

Fairer, or dearer,

Than Thou my Savior art to me.

**149** 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1 Our hearts are full of Christ and long

Their glorious matter to declare!

Of Him we make our loftier song,

We cannot from His praise forbear:

Our ready tongues make haste to sing

The glories of the heav’nly King.

2 Fairer than all the earthborn race,

Perfect in comeliness Thou art;

Replenished are Thy lips with grace,

And full of love Thy tender heart.

God ever-blest! we bow the knee,

And own all fullness dwells in Thee.

150. 8.6.8.6.

1 Lord Jesus! when we think of Thee,

Of all Thy love and grace,

Our spirits long and fain would see

Thy beauty face to face.

2 And though the wilderness we tread,

A barren, thirsty ground,

With thorns and briars overspread,

Where foes and snares abound;

3 Yet in Thy love such depths we see,

Our hearts o’erflow with praise—

Content ourselves, while, Lord to Thee

A joyful song we raise.

4 Our Lord, our Life, our Rest, our Shield,

Our Rock, our Food, our Light;

Each thought of Thee doth constant yield

Unchanging, fresh delight.

5 Blest Savior, keep our spirits stayed

Hard following after Thee,

Till we, in robes of white arrayed,

Thy face in glory see.
