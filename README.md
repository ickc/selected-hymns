Selected Hymns (詩歌選集) is a hymnal released by Tree of Life Publishers in 1995, which is later dicontinued due to copyright issue. This project is to provide a text-only version of the original hymnal. The long-term goal will be to identify the texts that has copyright issue and replaces it with one that is not.
