1 Break Thou the Bread of Life,

Dear Lord, to me,

As Thou didst break the loaves

Beside the sea;

Beyond the sacred page

I seek Thee, Lord;

My spirit pants for Thee,

O Living Word.

2 Thou art the Bread of Life,

O Lord, to me,

Thy holy Word the truth

That saveth me;

Give me to eat and live

With Thee above;

Teach me to love Thy truth,

For Thou art Love.

3 Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord,

Now unto me,

That He may touch my eyes,

And make me see;

Show me the truth concealed

Within Thy Word,

And in Thy Book revealed

I see the Lord.

4 Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,

To me, to me,

As Thou didst bless the bread

By Galilee;

Then shall all bondage cease,

All fetters fall,

And I shall find my peace,

My All in all.

**202** 8.6.8.6.D.

1 Thy Word is like a storehouse, Lord,

With full provision there,

And everyone who seeks may come,

Its glorious wealth to share.

Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine,

And jewels rich and rare

Are hidden in its mighty depths

For ev’ry searcher there.

2 Thy Word is like a starry host:

A thousand rays of light

Are seen to guide the traveler,

And make his pathway bright.

Thy Word is like an armory,

Where soldiers may repair,

And find, for life’s long battle day,

All needful weapons there.

3 O may I love Thy precious Word,

May I explore the mine,

May I its glorious riches take,

May light upon me shine.

O may I find my armor there,

Thy Word my trusty sword;

I’ll learn to fight with every foe

The battle of the Lord.

4 Word of the ever living God,

Will of His glorious Son;

Without Thee how could earth be trod,

Or God and Christ be won?

Lord, grant us all aright to learn

The wisdom it imparts,

And to its heav’nly teaching turn,

With simple, child-like hearts.

**203** 8.6.8.6.D.

1 We limit not the truth of God

To our poor reach of mind,

By notions of our day and sect,

Crude, partial and confined.

Now let a new and better hope

Within our hearts be stirred:

The Lord hath yet more light and truth

To break forth from His Word.

2 Who dares to bind by his dull sense

The oracles of heaven,

For all the nations, tongues and climes

And all the ages given!

The universe how much unknown!

That ocean unexplored!

The Lord hath yet more light and truth

To break forth from His Word.

3 Darkling our great forefathers went

The first steps of the way;

’Twas but the dawning yet to grow

Into the perfect day;

And grow it shall, our glorious Sun

More fervid rays afford:

The Lord hath yet more light and truth

To break forth from His Word.

4 The valleys past, ascending still,

Our souls would higher climb,

And look down from supernal heights,

On all the bygone times;

Upward we press, the air is clear,

And the sphere-music heard!

The Lord hath yet more light and truth

To break forth from His Word.

5 O Father, Son and Spirit, send

Us increase from above;

Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts

To comprehend Thy love;

And make us all go on to know

With nobler powers conferred:

The Lord hath yet more light and truth

To break forth from His Word.

**204** 8.6.8.6.

1 Jesus is longing for His Bride,

All glorious within.

His longing ill be satisfied

When she is fit for Him.

2 ’Tis by the Word the church is made

Holy and pure as He;

All spots and wrinkles it removes

That she His Bride may be.

3 We must redeem these golden days,

Receive the Word in prayer,

Amening every line and phrase,

And thus for Him prepare.

4 Oh, how the Word doth penetrate,

Spirit and soul divide,

Revealing every hidden weight

For us to lay aside.

5 Lord, how we thank Thee for Thy Word

Living and operative.

Oh, for Thy coming, we are stirred

Ever by it to live!

6 Lord, make us those who bring Thee back,

Who satisfy Thy heart.

Now by Thy Word supply our lack,

Make us Thy counterpart.

**205** 8.6.8.6.

1 Teach us to pray that we may cause

The enemy to flee,

That we his evil pow’r may bind,

His prisoners to free.

2 Teach us to pray and firmly stand

Upon the battleground,

To fight and break the stronghold down,

The enemy confound.

3 Teach us to pray and use Thy rod

In strong, prevailing prayer,

Beneath Thy blood to shake the earth

And powers of the air.

4 By prayer and faith, O may we learn

To labor, Lord. with Thee,

To know the victory is ours

And Thine authority.

**206** 7.7.7.3.

1 Christian, seek not yet repose,

Hear thy gracious Savior say;

Thou art in the midst of foes:

Watch and pray.

2 Principalities and powers,

Mustering their unseen array,

Wait for thy unguarded hours:

Watch and pray.

3 Gird thy heavenly armor on,

Wear it ever night and day;

Ambushed lies the evil one:

Watch and pray.

4 Hear the victors who o’ercame,

Still they mark each warrior’s way;

All with one sweet voice exclaim,

Watch and pray.

5 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,

Him thou lovest to obey;

Hide within thy heart His word:

Watch and pray.

6 Watch, as if on that alone

Hung the issue of the day;

Pray, that help may be sent down:

Watch and pray.

**207** 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1 In the mighty Name of Jesus,

When we bow before the Throne,

Many deadly foes are vanquished,

Many victories are won.

Mighty Name! Mighty Name!

In that Name alone we win.

Mighty Name! Mighty Name!

Conquering Satan, death and sin.

2 When we plead the Name of Jesus,

Satan and his hosts must flee.

Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!

In Thy Name is victory.

3 Soon shall come the blessed moment

When the battle shall be won,

When the Mighty Name of Jesus

Shall exalt us to the Throne.

**208** 8.7.8.7.

1 “Ask in faith,” the Name of Jesus

All your plea before the throne;

As you trust, the Lord will whisper,

“See, my child, the work is done.”

2 “Ask in faith,” God waits to answer

Each petition, Spirit-wrought;

He will work in wondrous power,

Far beyond your highest thought.

3 “Ask in faith,” ’tis just the asking,

In a faith that dares to stand,

Full of joyful expectation,

With an open, outstretched hand.

4 “Ask in faith,” for God is waiting

For thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.

Faith delights Him; faith can touch Him,

Every moment, everywhere.

**209** 10.9.10.9. with chorus

1 I must tell Jesus all of my trials;

I cannot bear these burdens alone;

In my distress He kindly will help me;

He ever loves and cares for His own.

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

I cannot bear my burden alone;

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

2 I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;

He is a kind, compassionate Friend;

If I but ask Him, He will deliver,

And in my griefs with me He will blend.

3 Tempted and tried I need a great Savior,

One who can help my burdens to bear;

I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;

He all my cares and sorrows will share.

4 O how the world to evil allures me!

O how my heart is tempted to sin!

I must tell Jesus; He will enable

Over the world the vict’ry to win.

**210** 8.7.8.7.D.

1 What a Friend we have in Jesus,

All our sins and griefs to bear!

What a privilege to carry

Ev’rything to God in prayer!

O what peace we often forfeit,

O what needless pain we bear,

All because we do not carry

Ev’rything to God in prayer!

2 Have we trials and temptations?

Is there trouble anywhere?

We should never be discouraged,

Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so faithful

Who will all our sorrows share?

Jesus knows our every weakness,

Take it to the Lord in prayer.

3 Are we weak and heavy-laden,

Cumbered with a load of care?

Precious Savior, still our refuge

Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?

Take it to the Lord in prayer:

In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,

Thou wilt find a solace there.

**211** 8.7.8.7.D. with repeat

1 In the secret of His presence

How my soul delights to hide!

Oh, how precious are the lessons

Which I learn at Jesus’ side!

Earthly cares can never vex me,

Neither trials lay me low;

For when Satan comes to tempt me,

To the secret place I go.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2 When my soul is faint and thirsty,

‘Neath the shadow of His wing

There is cool and pleasant shelter,

And a fresh and crystal spring;

And my Savior rests beside me,

As we hold communion sweet;

If I tried, I could not utter

What He says when thus we meet.

3 Only this I know: I tell Him

All my doubts and griefs and fears;

Oh, how patiently He listens!

And my drooping soul He cheers;

Do you think He ne’er reproves me?

What a false friend He would be,

If He never, never told me

Of the sins which He must see!

4 Would you like to know that sweetness

Of the secret of the Lord?

Go and hide beneath His shadow;

This shall then be your reward;

And whene’er you leave the silence

Of that happy meeting-place,

By the Spirit bear the image

Of the Master in your face.

**212** 8.7.8.7.D.

1 Sitting at the feet of Jesus,

O what words I hear Him say!

Happy place—so near, so precious!

May it find me there each day!

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,

I may look upon the past,

For His love has been so gracious—

It has won my heart at last.

2 Sitting at the feet of Jesus,

Where can mortals be more blest?

There I lay my sins and sorrows,

And, when weary, find sweet rest,

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,

There I love to weep and pray,

While I from His fullness gather

Grace and comfort every day.

3 Bless me, O my Savior, bless me,

As I sit low at Thy feet!

O look down in love upon me,

Let me see Thy face so sweet!

Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,

Make me holy as He is;

May I prove I’ve been with Jesus,

Who is all my righteousness.

1 “Keep the incense burning”

On the altar fire;

Let thy heart’s petition,

Let thy deep desire,

Be a cloud of incense

Wreathing God’s own throne,

Till His will among us

Shall be fully done.

2 “Keep the incense burning”

On the altar fire;

Feed the flame, Lord Jesus,

Till Thy whole desire

Shall in us, Thy children,

Find free course, and be

Breathed thro’ lips anointed

For this ministry.

3 “Keep the incense burning”

Though thy faith be weak;

Though in words thou canst not

All thy longing speak;

Silent heart-petitions,

Spirit-taught, will be

Gloriously answered;

Wrought by God for thee.

4 “Keep the incense burning”

Hourly let it rise,

Till from opened heavens,

Till from flame-swept skies,

Fire shall fall and kindle

All hearts to a flame;

Making us a glory

To our Savior’s name.

**214** 10.10.10.10.10.10.

1 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, I care not how,

But stir my heart in passion for the world,

Stir me to give, to go, but most to pray;

Stir till the blood-red banner be unfurled

O’er lands that still in heathen darkness lie,

O’er deserts where no cross is lifted high.

2 Stir me, oh! stir me, Lord, till all my heart

Is filled with strong compassion for these souls;

Till Thy compelling word drives me to pray;

Till Thy constraining love reach to the poles

Far north and south, in burning deep desire,

Till east and west are caught in love’s great fire.

3 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till prayer is pain,

Till prayer is joy, till prayer turns into praise;

Stir me, till heart and will and mind, yea, all

Is wholly Thine to use through all the days.

Stir, till I learn to pray exceedingly;

Stir, till I learn to wait expectantly.

4 Stir me, oh stir me, Lord, Thy heart was stirred

By love’s intensest fire, till Thou didst give

Thine only Son, Thy best beloved One,

E’en to the dreadful cross, that I might live.

Stir me to give myself so back to Thee,

That Thou canst give Thyself again through me.

5 Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, for I can see

Thy glorious triumph-day begin to break:

The dawn already gilds the eastern sky;

Oh, Church of Christ, arise, awake, awake.

Oh! stir us, Lord, as heralds of that day.

For night is past, our King is on His way.

**215** 7.7.7.7.

1 Father, let Thy kingdom come,

Let it come with living power,

Speak at length the final word,

Usher in the triumph hour.

2 As it came in the days of old,

In the deepest hearts of men,

When Thy martyrs died for Thee,

Let it come, O God, again.

3 Tyrant thrones and idol shrines,

Let them from their place be hurled;

Enter on Thy better reign,

Wear the crown of this poor world.

4 Oh, what long, sad years have gone,

Since Thy Church was taught this prayer;

Oh, what eyes have watched and wept

For the dawning everywhere.

5 Break, triumphant day of God!

Break at last our hearts to cheer;

Throbbing souls and holy songs

Wait to hail Thy dawning here.

6 Empires, temples, scepters, thrones,

May they all for God be won;

And, in every human heart,

Father, let Thy kingdom come.

**216** 8.6.8.6.D.

1 All heaven waits with bated breath,

For saints on earth to pray.

Majestic angels ready stand

With swords of fiery blade.

Astounding power awaits a word,

From God’s resplendent throne

But God awaits our prayer of faith

That cries “Your will be done.”

2 Awake, O church, Arise and pray,

Complaining words discard.

The Spirit comes to fill your mouth

With truth, His mighty sword.

Go place your feet on Satan’s ground

And there proclaim Christ’s name,

In step with heaven’s armies march

To conquer and to reign!

3 Now in our hearts and on our lips

The word of faith is near;

Let heaven’s will on earth be done,

Let heaven flow from here.

Come blend your prayers with Jesus’ own

Before the Father’s throne;

And as the incense clouds ascend

God’s holy fire rains down.

4 Soon comes the day when with a shout

King Jesus shall appear,

And with Him all the church

From every age shall fill the air.

The brightness of His coming shall

Consume the lawless one;

As with a word the breath of God

Tears down his rebel throne.

5 One body here by heav’n inspired,

We seek prophetic power.

In Christ agreed one heart and voice

To speak this day and hour.

In every place where chaos rules

And evil forces brood;

Let Jesus voice speak like the roar

Of a great multitude.

**217** 6.6.8.6.D.

1 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Now to Thy saints appear!

Oh, speak with power to ev’ry soul,

And let Thy people hear!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!

While here to Thee we bow;

Descend, O gracious Lord, descend!

Oh, come, and bless us now!

2 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And every soul inspire;

Oh, kindle in each heart, we pray,

The Pentecostal fire!

3 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Exalt Thy precious name!

And may Thy love in every heart

Be kindled to a flame!

4 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And bless to all Thy Word!

And may its pure and sacred truth

In living faith be heard!

5 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And make Thy servants bold;

Convict of sin and work once more

As in the days of old.

6 Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Give Pentecostal showers!

Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!

The blessing, Lord, be ours!

**218** 8.8.8.8.D.

1 Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,

That calls me from a world of care,

And bids me at my Father’s throne

Make all my wants and wishes known:

In seasons of distress and grief

My soul has often found relief,

And oft escaped the tempter’s snare

By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

2 Sweet hour of pray’r! sweet hour of pray’r,

The joy I feel, the bliss I share,

Of those whose anxious spirits bum

With strong desires for Thy return!

With such I hasten to the place

Where God, my Savior, shows His face,

And gladly take my station there,

And wait for thee, sweet hour of pray’r.

3 Sweet hour of pray’r! sweet hour of pray’r,

Thy wings shall my petition bear

To Him whose truth and faithfulness

Engage the waiting soul to bless;

And since He bids me seek His face,

Believe His word, and trust His grace.

I’ll cast on Him my ev’ry care,

And wait for thee, sweet hour of pray’r.

**219** Irregular Meter

1 Don’t you be in such a hurry,

‘Cause it only leads to worry,

There’s a time to work

but there’s a time to pray.

Try to find a quiet place

To hear His voice and seek His face.

Can you hear the Spirit calling

“come away”?

Come away, come away

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

Let your heart and mind be stilled,

Let you empty cup be filled.

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

2 Are you sinking in your sorrow,

Are you worried about tomorrow,

Are the pressures of this life

too hard to bear?

If you cast your cares on Him,

He’ll give you perfect peace within.

Can you hear the Spirit calling

“come away”?

Come away, come away

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

Come and spend some time with Me,

And My love will set you free.

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

1 The Church’s one foundation

Is Jesus Christ her Lord;

She is His new creation

By water and the Word:

From heav’n He came and sought her

To be His holy Bride;

With His own blood He bought her,

And for her life He died.

2 Elect from every nation,

Yet one o’er all the earth,

Her charter of salvation,

One Lord, one faith, one birth;

One holy Name she blesses,

Partakes one holy food,

And to one hope she presses,

With every grace endued.

3 ’Mid toil and tribulation,

And tumult of her war,

She waits the consummation

Of peace for evermore;

Till, with the vision glorious,

Her longing eyes are blest,

And the great Church victorious

Shall be the Church at rest.

4 Yet she on earth hath union

With God the Three in One,

And mystic sweet communion

With those whose rest is won:

O happy ones and holy!

Lord, give us grace that we,

Like them, the meek and lowly,

In love may dwell with Thee.

**221** 8.7.8.7.D.

1 Church of God, beloved and chosen,

Church of Christ for whom He died,

Claim thy gifts and praise the Giver,

Ye are washed and sanctified.

Sanctified by God the Father,

And by Jesus Christ His Son,

And by God the Holy Spirit,

Holy, Holy, Three in One.

2 By His will He sanctifieth,

By the Spirit’s power within;

By the loving hand that chasteneth

Fruits of righteousness to win;

By His truth and by His promise,

By the Word, His gift unpriced,

By His own blood, and by union

With the risen life of Christ.

3 Holiness by faith in Jesus,

Not by effort of thine own,

Sin’s dominion crushed and broken

By the power of grace alone,

Christ, the holiness within thee,

His own beauty on thy brow:

This shall be thy pilgrim brightness,

This thy blessed portion now.

4 He will sanctify thee wholly;

Body, spirit, soul shall be

Blameless till thy Savior’s coming

In His glorious majesty!

He hath perfected forever

Those whom He hath sanctified;

Spotless, glorious, and holy,

Is the Church, His chosen Bride.

**222** 8.8.8.8.

1 On Christ, salvation rests secure;

The Rock of Ages must endure;

Nor can that faith be overthrown

Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”

2 No other hope shall intervene;

To Him we look, on Him we lean;

Other foundations we disown,

And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”

3 In Him it is ordained to raise

A temple to Jehovah’s praise,

Composed of all His saints, who own

No Savior but the “Living Stone.”

4 View the vast building, see it rise:

The work how great! the plan how wise!

O wondrous fabric! pow’r unknown:

That rests it on the “Living Stone.”

5 But most adore His precious name:

His glory and His grace proclaim!

For us, the lost, condemned, undone,

He gave Himself, the “Living Stone.”

**223** 8.8.8.8.8.8. with repeat

1 Oh, what a might! Oh, what a strength!

God wrought to raise Christ from the dead.

Far above all at His right hand,

O’er all to us He is the Head.

All this great pow’r is to the Church

That she o’er all her foes may tread.

(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)

2 Oh, what a fact! Oh, what a bliss!

That I of Christ a member am.

With all the saints I blend as one

And share the life of the new man.

Joined to our great ascended Head,

We’ll be the Church of His own plan,

3 Oh, what a breadth! Oh, what a length!

The height, the depth unsearchable!

Christ the Lord is unlimited,

So vast, immense, immeasurable.

All that He is and all He has

Is now our life unspeakable.

**224** 9.8.8.9. with chorus

1 Father God, Thou art the source of life.

We, Thy sons, are Thine expression;

In Thy name, our dear possession.

Father God, Thou art the source of life.

In Thy life, in Thy life,

We have oneness in Thy life.

In Thy life, in Thy life,

In Thy life, O Father, we are one.

2 How we thank Thee that Thy holy Word

With Thy nature, saturates us;

From the world it separates us.

Thank Thee, Father, for Thy holy Word.

Through Thy Word, through Thy Word,

We have oneness through Thy Word.

Through Thy Word, through Thy Word,

Through Thy holy Word we’re all made one.

3 Oh, the glory of the Triune God!

We’re His sons, oh, what a blessing!

We His glory are expressing—

Oh, the glory of the Triune God!

In Thy glory, in Thy glory,

In Thy glory we are one.

In Thy glory, in Thy glory,

In Thy glory we are all made one!

1 Let party names no more

The Christian world o’erspread;

Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,

Are one in Christ, their Head.

2 Among the saints on earth

Let mutual love be found;

Heirs of the same inheritance,

With mutual blessings crowned.

3 Let envy, child of hell!

Be banished far away:

Those in sweet fellowship should dwell,

Who the same Lord obey.

4 Thus will the Church below

God’s purpose ever prove;

Where streams of endless pleasure flow,

And every heart is love.

**226** 8.7.8.7.D.

1 Saints in Christ! Why thus divided?

Christ is not divided so;

Surely all should be together,

Who the same Redeemer know.

By the same blood-shedding purchased,

Destined to the same bright Home—

Why on earth divided? Jesus

Bids you all together come.

2 Saints in Christ! break down the barriers

Man has reared on every side,

Make a living Christ the Center—

Gather to the Crucified;

Let not sects and parties longer

Separate the “flock of God”—

Jesus died in one to gather

All the scattered ones abroad.

3 Saints in Christ! a living union

Flows but from the Living Head;

Saints, alas, are ever making

Union in the flesh instead.

Such a union Scripture knows not,

Such, its pages must disown;

God the Spirit draws to Jesus,

Him exalts and Him alone.

4 Saints in Christ! O, what a witness

For the Savior we should be

Were we all around Him gathered

In the “Spirit’s unity.”

What a sight for men to look on!

What a truth it would proclaim!

What a glory it would render

To our blessed Savior’s name!

5 Saints in Christ! soon, soon our Master

Whom we love, from heaven will come;

And with happy shouts of triumph,

Bear us to our blissful home!

Then the Cross exchanged for Glory—

Service, for the bright reward;

Then—oh! blessed hope we shall be

ONE, “for ever with the Lord!”

**227** 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1 Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd

Brought us right out of the fold

Into His pasture so plenteous,

Into His riches untold.

Glorious church life,

Feasting from such a rich store!

Here where we’re dwelling in oneness

God commands life evermore.

2 In the divisions He sought us,

Weary and famished for food;

Into the good land He brought us,

Oh, to our spirit how good!

3 Jesus Himself is our pasture,

He is the food that we eat;

We as His sheep are fed richly

Each time, whenever we meet.

4 Dwell we here on a high mountain,

Wet with the morning-fresh dew,

Quenching our thirst at the fountain,

Water so living and new.

5 Christ is our rest and enjoyment,

Here we have nothing to fear;

Here all the sheep dwell securely,

Kept by His presence so dear.

**228** 6.6.6.6.8.8.

1 Behold how good a thing

It is to dwell in peace;

How pleasing to our King,

This fruit of righteousness;

When brethren all in one agree,

They know the joy of unity!

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2 When all are sweetly joined

(True followers of the Lamb),

They’re one in heart and mind,

They think and speak the same;

When all in love together dwell;

The comfort is unspeakable!

3 Where unity is found,

The joys of heav’n we prove;

This is the gospel grace,

The unction from above;

The Spirit on all saints is shed,

Descending swift from Christ the Head.

4 Where unity takes place,

The sweet anointing grace

Extends to all around,

And shines from every face;

To every praising saint it comes,

And fills him with divine perfumes.

5 On all His chosen ones

The precious oil comes down:

Anointing as it runs,

Anointing on and on.

E’en to His skirts (the meanest name

That longs to love the bleeding Lamb).

6 From Aaron’s beard it rolls,

(Those nearest to His face),

The humble, trembling souls

Who know abundant grace;

The grace, the grace for all is free,

For, lo, it reaches now to me!

1.  Splendid church life! His green garden!

He has brought us, praise the Lord,

To experience the Christ Who’s growing here!

He is full of rich enjoyment

to His saints in one accord;

He is new and fresh, available and dear.

I’m so happy in this lovely place,

In the garden growing in His grace!

There is no finer pleasure

than to eat the living tree

And to get the living water into me.

1.  It is not a school or fact’ry

or a chapel in the air;

But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.

So He’s placed us all here

corporately to be His garden fair,

Where He’s free to cultivate and make us grow.

1.  Thus within the church-life garden

there’s a fruit-producing tree

Full of life and so available to eat.

So be simple, don’t be hardened,

drop your concepts-eat that tree!

Take in Jesus every moment-He’s so sweet!

1.  With the tree there is the water,

flowing God in Christ to us,

Quenching all our dryness,

ending all our strife.

Hallelujah! In His garden

Jesus flows Himself to us,

5 Aren’t you satisfied and thankful

that our Lord has brought you in

Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?

So be happy and be joyful,

in the spirit feast on Him,

So God’s garden can bear fruit abundantly.

Hear us, who Thy nature share,

Who Thy mystic body are.

2 Join us, in one spirit join,

Let us still receive of Thine;

Still for more on Thee we call,

Thou who fillest all in all.

3 Move, and actuate, and guide:

Divers gifts to each divide;

Placed according to Thy will,

Let us all our work fulfil.

4 Sweetly may we all agree,

Touched with loving sympathy;

Kindly for each other care,

Every member feel its share.

5 Love, like death, hath all destroyed,

Rendered all distinctions void;

Names, and sects, and parties fall:

Thou, O Christ, art all in all.

1 How sweet, how heav’nly is the sight,

When those who love the Lord

In one another’s peace delight,

And so fulfill His Word;

2.  When each can feel his brother’s sigh,

And with him bear a part;

When sorrow flows from eye to eye,

And joy from heart to heart;

3 When, free from envy, seem and pride,

Our wishes all above,

Each can his brother’s failings hide,

And show a brother’s love;

4 When love, in one delightful stream,

Through every bosom flows;

When union sweet, and dear esteem,

In every action glows.

5 Love is the golden chain that binds;

The saints Thy grace thus prove.

And he is glory’s heir that finds

His bosom glow with love.

1 Blest be the tie that binds

Our hearts in Christian love,

The fellowship our spirit finds

Is like to that above.

2 Before our Father’s throne,

We pour our ardent pray’rs;

Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one--

Our comforts and our cares.

3 We share our mutual woes;

Our mutual burdens bear;

And often for each other flows

The sympathizing tear.

4 When we asunder part,

It gives us inward pain;

But we shall still be joined in heart,

And hope to meet again.

5 From sorrow, toil, and pain,

And sin we shall be free;

And perfect love and oneness reign

Through all eternity.

1 All praise to our redeeming Lord,

Who joins us by His grace,

And bids us, each to each restored,

Together seek His face.

2 He bids us build each other up;

And, gathered into one,

To our high calling’s glorious hope,

We hand in hand go on.

3 The gift which He on one bestows,

We all delight to prove;

The grace through every vessel flows,

In purest streams of love.

4 We all partake the joy of one;

The common peace we feel;

A peace to worldly minds unknown,

A joy unspeakable.

5 And if our fellowship below

In Christ yet be so sweet,

What height of rapture shall we know,

When round His throne we meet!

Welcome to the family,

We’re glad that you have come

To share your life with us,

As we grow in love,

And may we always be to you

What God would have us be,

A fam’ly always there,

To be strong and to lean on.

May we learn to love each other

More with each new day,

May words of love be on our lips

In ev’rything we say.

May the Spirit melt our hearts

And teach us how to pray,

That we might be a true family.

1 Lord, to know Thee as the Body,

Is my desperate need today,

Oh, to see Thee in Thy member,

‘Tis for this I long and pray.

No more just to know Thy headship,

In an individual way,

But to see Thee incarnated,

In Thy Body, Lord, I pray.

2 Through the years, Thy saints have sought Thee,

Longing for reality;

Gazing upward, searching inward,

Thirsting for the sight of Thee.

Now reveal that Christ in heaven,

Is the Body manifest;

And the Christ who dwells within us

As the Body is expressed.

3 Prone to be misled, I know it,

By my lofty thoughts of Thee,

Easy ’tis for self to seek Thee,

Yet not touch reality,

Oh, how much I need to find Thee,

In Thy members here below.

God eternal dwells among us,

Manifest in flesh to know.

4 Limit, Lord, my independence,

Let me to Thy Body turn;

Not just seeking light from heaven,

But the church’s sense to learn.

May we be the stones for building,

Not the formless, useless clay,

Gain in us Thy heart’s desire,

Corporately Thyself display.

**236** 6.6.8.6.

1 I love Thy kingdom, Lord,

The house of Thine abode,

The Church our blest Redeemer bought

With His own precious blood.

2 I love the Church, O God!

Her walls before Thee stand,

Dear as the apple of Thine eye

And graven on Thy hand.

3 For her my tears shall fall,

For her my prayers ascend;

To her my cares and toils be given

Till toils and cares shall end.

4 Beyond my highest joy

I prize her heavenly ways,

Her sweet communion, solemn vows,

Her hymns of love and praise.

5 Sure as Thy truth shall last,

To Zion shall be given

The brightest glories earth can yield,

And brighter bliss of heaven.

Hallelujah for the Body!

Satan trembles at the Body!

We’re victorious in the Body!

Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

in the nature all divine—

Nothing natural does the Body life allow.

When we’re one and share God’s nature,

how the lampstand then does shine—

Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

Hallelujah for the Body!

For the lampstands of the Body!

For the golden, shining Body!

Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

be divine and shining too?

Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!

He’s the tree of life, the manna,

and the feast that’s ever new—

Hallelujah, we may eat Him every day!

We are one by eating Jesus!

We’re divine by eating Jesus!

How we shine by eating Jesus!

Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!

1 The Bible is the Word of God,

Its message is but one—

Christ and the church, His holy Bride,

The two becoming one.

Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!

Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside

That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air

And ever in our Bridegroom’s love abide.

2 The Father is the mighty God,

His purpose is but one—

To find a Bride for Christ the Lord

And give her to His Son.

3 The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,

His heart desire’s but one—

To have a loving counterpart,

A Bride He’s wooed and won.

4 The Spirit is but Christ Himself,

He is the Lord applied

To generate the men of earth,

Transform them as His Bride.

A Bride all-glorious.

With spirits stirred and burning, now let us come

May none his part with others in building shirk.

“I’ll not come into my house,

Nor go up to my bed,

Give slumber to my eyelids—

Until I find a place for Thee,

A place, O Lord, for Thee.”

To dwell with all His own.

2 How blinded we have been,

Shut in with what concerns us;

While God’s house lieth waste—

Lord, break through all and turn us!

We’ll go up to the mountain,

Bring wood and build the house;

We’ll never say, “Another day!”

It’s time to come and build.

3 O Lord, against these days,

Inspire some for Your building,

Just as in David’s day—

A remnant who are willing

To come and work in Your house,

Oh, what a blessed charge!

Your heart’s desire, is our desire—

We give ourselves to build.

4 Within those whom You’d call

Put such a restless caring

For building to give all—

The gates of hell cannot prevail

Against the builded Church!

The hours are few, the builders too—

We rise, O Lord, to build!

1 See the golden lampstands,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Jesus’ testimony,

Bearing Him as light.

Formed by Him, unmeasured,

In the Spirit’s mold—

All are one in nature,

One pure work of gold.

See the golden lampstand,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Burning in the Spirit,

Shining forth with Christ.

2 God in Christ, embodied,

As God’s lampstand, He

Has become the Spirit,

The reality.

Spirit as the lampstand

Has been multiplied;

Many golden lampstands,

Now are realized!

3 Caring for the churches

Is the Son of Man:

Voice of many waters,

Stars in His right hand;

Eyes aflame; His face is

Shining as the sun;

Churches—fear no trial,

He’s the living One!

4 What can quench the lampstands?

Who can them defy?

More the opposition—

More they multiply!

Deeper darkness ‘round them,

Brighter do they shine.

They are constituted

With the life divine.

5 Soon the golden lampstands

Shall the Bride become,

Bringing in that city—

New Jerusalem.

Then the many lampstands

Shall one lampstand be;

Triune God expressing,

Universally.

Lo, from heav’n descending,

All the earth shall see

God’s complete expression,

For eternity.

1 The churches are the Body

Of Christ on earth today.

They are His testimony,

That He may have a way.

They are the golden lampstands

In cities far and wide.

They are His fighting army,

And His beloved Bride.

The churches, the churches,

Upon the earth today;

Lord stir our hearts for Thy desire,

And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

2 Oh, how we need the churches,

All of them, great or small!

We need their many portions

To profit us withal.

Yes, Lord, enlarge the churches;

We love their needs to bear.

Enlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,

In fellowship and prayer.

3 The Lord’s eyes o’er the whole earth

Are running to and fro;

Those seven, burning, searching,

Our heart’s desire to know.

His purpose—many churches,

Built up in one accord;

This golden testimony

Will thus express the Lord.

4 And soon will be the coming

Of our triumphant King!

He’s coming for the churches

Where His sweet praises ring.

Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,

As draws the harvest nigh,

And to Thy throne do take us,

To reign with Thee on high.

1 In Revelation chapter one

God gives a vision of the Son,

Of Him who was and is to come;

Oh, let us to this One now come.

2 In spirit hear His trumpet voice;

We must be turned to see His choice

The seven lampstands golden fair;

The Son of Man is walking there.

3 The great high priestly robe He wears,

For every church He fully cares:

He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;

He makes them bum, flames in His eyes.

4 A golden girdle on His breast—

His work is done, and from His rest

He unto all the churches pours

Himself in love, the treasure store.

5 His head, His hair is white as wool

The ancient One with youth is full.

His face is shining as the sun

To burn and lighten every one.

6 Oh, when this living One we see,

We’ll fall as dead, we’ll finished be.

But then the Lord His comfort gives

He once was dead, but now He lives.

His riches then He will outpour.

1 In Revelation two and three,

The seven local churches see:

The lessons there for you and me

Are for the Lord’s recovery.

2 The words to them are words to us,

So that the church be glorious,

And all their warnings we must heed

So that the Lord can meet His need.

3 To Ephesus, the word is clear:

“To your first love you’re not so near;

You’ve left to work so far away;

Repent, return to Him today.”

4 Thus, we must all turn back to Him,

Leave other loves, for these are sin.

Oh, let us hearken to His call—

If we miss this, we’ve missed it all!

5 Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore—

“You have been tried, but something more—

Be faithful unto death,” we’re told

(Not just of body but of soul).

6 Be faithful ‘til what’s natural dies;

Your circumstances don’t despise;

The Lord has sent them all to you

To prove that your first love is true.

7 From Pergamos we clearly see

The world has wed Christianity!

And faithful Antipas did fall—

He dared to stand against it all.

8 To wed the world we all must fear:

His spoken word will save us here—

If to His speaking we give heed,

We’ll separated be indeed.

9 Then Thyatira comes at length:

Her mixture with the world her strength.

Fine flour leavened by the yeast,

A harlot riding on a beast.

10 Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;

To us this mixture fully show.

Each added thing we will refute

Until we’re wholly absolute.

11 And then from Sardis, we can know

Life is the way that we must go!

She says she’s living, but she’s dead;

She needs to touch the Lord instead.

12 Lord, take us all the way to life

To overcome the deadness rife.

Away from deadness we would flee

That full of life we’ll always be.

13 Now Philadelphia comes at last;

That which she has she should hold fast—

The brothers’ love, the name, the word;

This church has satisfied the Lord.

14 We as the brothers all are one;

We’re one by life, and life alone.

If we His word and name do keep

A glorious building God will reap.

15 Laodicea warns us all:

From Philadelphia some will fall.

By saying, “I am rich,” it’s then

The Lord is outside wanting in.

16 Lukewarmness we must ever spurn

And in the spirit always bum,

The inward life experience gain,

And pay the price with Him to reign.

17 Lord, shine Your light on us today

That we may fully go Your way;

Anoint our eyes and let us see

So You can have recovery.

He has spoken; it is done.

2 Hallelujah, Philadelphia,

Thine are works that please the Lord.

Strength thou hast, though just a little

And hast kept His living Word.

But confessed it here below—

Lo, a door is set before thee,

Through which none but thee can go.

3 Thou, beloved Philadelphia,

Dost His Word of patience keep.

From the hour of trial He’ll save thee,

Which o’er all the world shall sweep.

Troublers too shall know He loves thee;

They to thee must then bow down.

“Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,

That no man may take thy crown.”

4 Hallelujah, overcomers,

“In the temple of My God,

I will build them in as pillars,

Nevermore to go abroad.”

God’s own name is written on them

And the new name of the Lord.

They’re the city of our God.

Gates of pearl and walls of jasper,

Mingled with each precious gem.

Has become His Bride so dear.

Now the Spirit in the churches

Speaks to all who have an ear.

He has spoken in His word;

And confirmed it by the churches,

For His Spirit we have heard.

2 Not to all the seven churches

Did the Lord speak in this way;

To the church in Philadelphia

Did He choose these words to say.

3 Philadelphia, Philadelphia,

Church so full of brotherly love,

You’re the church to bring the Bridegroom

Back to earth from heav’n above.

4 He that hath the key of David,

He that shuts and opens too,

Knows thy works, O Philadelphia;

That’s why you’re His Bride so true.

5 Not so strong by worldly standards,

Hidden from religion’s fame;

Jesus loves you, Philadelphia,

For you’re faithful to His name.

6 By His Word you’re overcoming—

How the Amen does resound!

Just hold fast to what you’ve gotten,

That no man may take your crown.

7 You have kept His Word of patience;

He will keep you from that hour

Which upon the whole world cometh

When the Lord comes in His power.

Quickly come, Lord Jesus”,

Baptized in death’s dark waters,

For us Thy blood was shed;

For us Thou, Lord of Glory,

Wast numbered with the dead.

We’re ransomed by Thy blood.

And here would walk as strangers.

Alive with Thee to God.
