1 The love of God is greater far

Than tongue or pen can ever tell.

It goes beyond the highest star

And reaches to the lowest hell.

The guilty pair, bowed down with care

His Son to win;

His erring child He reconciled

from his sin.

O love of God, how rich and pure!

How measureless and strong!

It shall forevermore endure

The saints’ and angels’ song.

2 When hoary time shall pass away,

And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;

When men who here refuse to pray,

On rocks and hills and mountains call;

God’s love, so sure, shall still endure,

All measureless and strong;

Redeeming grace to Adam’s race

The saints’ and angels’ song.

3 Could we with ink the ocean fill,

And were the skies of parchment made;

Were every stalk on earth a quill,

And every man a scribe by trade;

To write the love of God above

Would drain the ocean dry;

Nor could the scroll contain the whole,

Though stretched from sky to sky.

Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,

Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,

What will He not bestow?

3 He spared not His Son!

‘Tis this that silences each rising fear,

‘Tis this that bids the hard tho’t disappear;

He spared not His Son!

Hail! as our Father and our God!

For we are Thine by sacred ties,

Thy sons and daughters—bought with blood.

That far from Thee we ne’er may move;

Then, in believing, peace we found,

And in Thy Christ we live.

All that we hope to be,

When Jesus comes and glory dawns,

We owe it all to Thee.

4 O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,

Whoe’er can Thee repay?

Thy love is past man’s finding out,

Thy grace no man can say.

5 But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,

More clearly may I see,

That I may e’er more fully know

How much I owe to Thee.

6 But if man’s heart should e’er suppose

He could repay Thy love,

It only means he nothing knows

Of love, all loves above.

With that dear love of Thine:

The love that made Thine heart once break,

Whoe’er that love could win?

8 Then nevermore suggest return,

His love is far too high;

But let our hearts with rapture burn

That He for us should die.

For Thou hast stooped to ask of me

The love of my poor heart.

6 No earthly father loves like Thee;

No mother, e’er so mild

Bears and forbears as Thou hast done

With me, Thy sinful child.

What rapture will it be

Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,

And gaze, and gaze on Thee.

There is healing in His blood.

4 We bow in worship now before Thy throne,

By faith the Object of Thy love would see;

Who, in the midst, His brethren’s song doth lead.

To Him, our Savior, shall the glory be!

**038** 10.10.10.10.

1 Our God and Father we respond anew

To love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy name.

He did Thy will; and for the joy in view,

Endured the cross, despising all the shame.

2 He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise;

We hear His song, our hearts responsive swell;

And on this day when He His voice doth raise,

In spirit we do join and praise Thee well.

3 Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son,

We have our part in joy before Thy face;

Predestined, ere this world had yet begun,

For that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace.

4 Sons loved and loving, whom Thy spirit fills,

Our endless portion Christ in us to be;

Each with some trait of Him whose love us thrills,

For Thy delight and joy eternally.

**039** 10.4.10.4.10.10.

1 Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise

With all Thine own;

And in Thy presence sound a note of praise

To Thee alone;

Bro’t nigh, bro’t home to Thee—O wondrous grace,

That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.

2 How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,

Where love is known!

Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,

In Him alone;

As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,

He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.

3 He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear

The song He sings!

How precious, too, to Thee—how near, how dear

Are those He brings

To share His place: ’twas thus that Thou didst plan;

Thou lovedst Him before the world began.

**040** 8.8.8.8.D.

1 The spacious firmament on high,

With all the blue ethereal sky,

And spangled heav’ns, a shining frame,

Their great Original proclaim.

Th’unwearied sun, from day to day,

Does his Creator’s pow’r display;

And publishes to every land

The work of an almighty hand.

2 Soon as the evening shades prevail,

The moon takes up the wondrous tale;

And nightly to the listening earth

Repeats the story of her birth;

While all the stars that round her burn,

And all the planets in their turn,

Confirm the tidings as they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole.

3 What though in solemn silence all

Move round the dark terrestrial ball?

What though no real voice nor sound

Amid the radiant orbs be found?

In reason’s ear they all rejoice,

And utter forth a glorious voice,

Forever singing as they shine,

“The hand that made us is divine.”

**041** 11.11.11.11.

1 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,

In light in accessible hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,

Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

2 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,

Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;

Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,

Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

3 To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;

In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;

We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,

And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.

4 Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,

Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;

All laud we would render, O help us to see:

’Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.

5 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,

In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,

Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

**042** 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1 Thou art the everlasting Word,

The Father’s only Son,

God manifestly seen and heard,

And heav’n’s beloved One.

Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,

That ev’ry knee to Thee should bow!

2 In Thee, most perfectly expressed,

The Father’s glories shine,

Of the full Deity possessed,

Eternally Divine!

3 True image of the Infinite,

Whose essence is concealed;

Brightness of uncreated light,

The heart of God revealed.

4 But the high myst’ries of His name

The creature’s grasp transcend;

The Father only \[glorious claim\]!

The Son can comprehend.

**5** Thro’out the universe of bliss,

The center Thou, and Sun,

Th’ eternal theme of praise is this,

To heav’n’s beloved One.

**043** 11.11.11.11.

1 The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,

The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.

His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell

The man who in God’s tabernacle may dwell.

2 “Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide”—

In God He took refuge whate’er did betide.

“O Thou art my Lord, I’ve no good beyond Thee”

He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.

3 “As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,”

To Him they’re the people of excellent worth.

Of them He has said He has all His delight—

In proving this all the four Gospels unite.

4 “The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup”—

For everything He to the Father looked up.

“The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give”

Himself He denied and by God’s word did live.

5 His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,

And e’en in His death praise to God could be voiced;

His soul God would never abandon to hell,

But in resurrection His body would dwell.

6 God raised Him, and He with God’s glory was crowned;

Then fullness of joy in God’s presence He found.

E’en now at the Father’s right hand is His seat,

Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.

**044** 7.6.7.6.D.

1 O soul inspiring story—

God’s majesty and grace

In lustrous strokes of glory

Deep-carved in Jesus’ face!

Hearts rapt in contemplation

Of Godhead’s Image bright,

Break forth in adoration,

In wonder and delight!

2 There Manhood, all perfection,

And Godhead-fullness shine;

God’s love and Man’s affection,

The human, the divine;

A life, a death, transcendent,

Revealing God as love:

Here, lowly Man, dependent

God over all, above!

3 Unsullied blaze of glory!

O ever-radiant Face!

Thy rich, unfathomed story

Transfigures us in grace!

Made like Thee, soon, completely,

With love-lit eyes we’ll scan

God’s face unveiled so sweetly

In Thine, Thou Son of man!

**045** 13.13.13.14. with chorus

1 O how nigh the Lord is unto all who call on Him!

When we call, His very presence strengthens us within.

Seeking Jesus, He is found, and calling, He is near—

O what a comfort to our hearts to call His name so dear!

Jesus! O what a name!

O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!

Name victorious, name all-glorious,

Name exalted—O what a name!

Jesus! Strengthening name!

O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!

Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,

“O Lord Jesus!” O what a name!

2 Call upon the name of Jesus, and you will be saved,

O Lord Jesus, hallelujah, nevermore enslaved!

We may take salvation’s cup by calling on the Lord;

Salvation from a host of things does His dear name

afford.

3 To the Lord, the Jew, the Greek and everyone’s the same;

He is rich unto all men that call upon His name.

O Lord Jesus, what a joy to call and really live;

When breathing in Thy name, what pleasure Thou to us

dost give.

4 In the God of our salvation we may take delight,

Calling on His name at all times, though in bliss or blight.

I will call upon His name as long as I shall live,

Because He has inclined His ear, and grace so full does

give.

5 We will call upon the Lord, who’s worthy of our praise;

Thus our grateful hearts in worship we to Him may raise.

We are those who call upon His name in every place

With all the saints who from a pure heart call and taste

His grace.

**046** 6.5.6.5.D.

1 In the Name of Jesus

Ev’ry knee shall bow,

Ev’ry tongue confess Him

King of glory now;

‘Tis the Father’s pleasure

We should call Him Lord,

Who from the beginning

Was the Mighty Word.

2 At His voice creation

Sprang at once to sight:

All the angel faces,

All the hosts of light,

Thrones and dominations,

Stars upon their way,

All the heav’nly orders,

In their great array.

3 Humbled for a season,

To receive a Name

From the lips of sinners

Unto whom He came,

Faithfully He bore it

Spotless to the last,

Brought it back victorious,

When from death He passed.

4 Bore it up triumphant,

With its human light,

Through all ranks of creatures,

To the central height;

To the throne of Godhead,

To the Father’s breast,

Filled it with the glory

Of that perfect rest.

5 Name Him, brothers, name Him,

With love strong as death,

But with awe and wonder,

And with bated breath;

He is God the Savior,

He is Christ the Lord,

Ever to be worshiped,

Trusted, and adored.

6 In your hearts enthrone Him;

There let Him subdue

All that is not holy,

All that is not true;

Crown Him as your Captain

In temptation’s hour;

Let His will enfold you

In its light and power.

7 Brothers, this Lord Jesus

Shall return again,

With His Father’s glory,

With His angel train;

For all wreaths of empire

Meet upon His brow,

And our hearts confess Him

King of glory now.

**047** 8.8.8.8.

1 Lift that Name high! That glorious Name,

Let heav’n and earth its pow’r proclaim;

Our mighty, conqu’ring, coming King,

Earth yet shall with His praises ring.

2 Lift that Name high! To that high tower

We flee in every trial hour,

Safe, sheltered, satisfied and free,

For Jesus’ Name is victory.

3 Lift that Name high! Until one day

His mighty Name the earth shall sway,

And sin and death, distress and pain

Shall be no more, for Christ shall reign.

4 Lift that Name high! Jesus shall reign,

And kings shall follow in His train;

Lift that Name high, all names above,

The Name of Him we own and love.

5 Lift that Name high! For every knee

Shall bow to Him; Jesus shall see

Fruit of His Cross, when earth shall bring

Her tribute to her Lord and King.

**048** 8.8.8.8.

1 Thy name is as ointment poured forth:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,

Thy name is as ointment poured forth,

Thy name is as ointment poured forth.

2 Therefore do the virgins love Thee:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

Therefore do the virgins love Thee,

Therefore do the virgins love Thee.

3 Thy love is much better than wine:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

Thy love is much better than wine,

Thy love is much better than wine.

4 Draw me, we will run after Thee:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

Draw me, we will run after Thee,

Draw me, we will run after Thee.

5 Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved,

Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved.

6 I found Him whom my soul doth love:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

I found Him whom my soul doth love,

I found Him whom my soul doth love.

7 I held Him and would not let go:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

I held Him and would not let go,

I held Him and would not let go.

8 Make haste, my Beloved, to come:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

Make haste, my Beloved, to come,

Make haste, my Beloved, to come.

9 We love Thee with all of our heart:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

We love Thee with all of our heart,

We love Thee with all of our heart.

**049** 8.8.8.7. with chorus

1 The name of Jesus is so sweet,

I love its music to repeat;

It makes my joys full and complete,

The precious name of Jesus.

Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,

Jesus! Ev’ry day the same;

Jesus! Let all saints proclaim

Its worthy praise forever.

2 I love the name of Him whose heart

Knows all my griefs and bears a part;

Who bids all anxious fears depart,

I love the name of Jesus.

3 That name I fondly love to hear,

It never fails my heart to cheer,

Its music dries the failing tear;

Exalt the name of Jesus.

4 No word of man can ever tell

How sweet the name I love so well,

Oh, let its praises ever swell,

Oh, praise the name of Jesus.

**050** 7.7.8.7.D.

1 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus,

And lowly bow before Thee;

And while we live, to Thee we give

All blessing, worship, glory.

We sing aloud Thy praises, :

Our hearts and voices blending,

‘Tis Thou alone we worthy own,

Thy beauty’s all-transcending.

2 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus:

It tells God’s love unbounded

To ruined man, ere time began,

Or heav’n and earth were founded:

Thine is a love eternal,

That found in us its pleasure,

That brought Thee low to bear our woe

And make us Thine own treasure.

3 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;

It tells Thy birth so lowly,

Thy patience, grace, and gentleness.

Thy lonely path, so holy;

Thou wast the “Man of Sorrows”

Our grief, too, Thou didst bear it;

Our bitter cup Thou drankest up;

The thorny crown, didst wear it.

4 Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;

God’s Lamb—Thou wast ordained,

To bear our sins (Thyself all clean)

And hast our guilt sustained.

We see Thee crowned in glory,

Above the heavens now seated,

The vict’ry won, Thy work well done,

Our righteousness completed.
