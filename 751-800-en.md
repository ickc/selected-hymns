Thou Giver of all good!

The gift had been in vain.

Our sins buried in Thee,

Cover'd is our unrighteousness,

From all debts we are free.

The footprints of Thy love,

And know the riches of Thy grace,

The holy righteousness.

5 Though heart may fail and flesh decay,

On firm ground we remain,

When earth and heav'n shall pass away,

Our anchor shall sustain.

6 Until that day, we then shall prove,

The full worth of Thy love.

But here on earth, my life still needs

Thy great sustaining power.

7 We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,

To Thee our all we owe;

The precious Saviour, and the power

That makes Him precious too.

Whene'er we think on Thee,

And long that to Thy presence dear

We soon might raptured be!

Lord, like the pretty henna-flower,

In vineyards blossoming Thou art;

Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,

Admires and loves our heart!

2 There is no music adequate

Thy grace in full to praise,

Nor there a heart which could enjoy

Thy love in every phase.

Is not Thy love, Thy grace;

But it is Thine own loving Self

That satisfies always.

And sweeter than the sweet;

Beside Thee, none in heaven or earth

Our heart's desire could meet.

See us waiting for the fire,

Waiting, waiting,

See us waiting for the fire.

Soul and body, mind and will;

All the evil passions slay,

Come, and every corner fill.

3 Now the sacrifice we make,

Though as dear as a right eye,

For our blessed Savior's sake,

Who for us did bleed and die.

4 Now, by faith, the gift I claim,

Bought for me by blood divine:

Through the all-prevailing Name

All the promises are mine.

1 While fighting for my Savior here,

the devil tries me hard;

He uses all his mighty pow’r,

my progress to retard;

He’s up to ev’ry move,

And yet thro’ all I prove

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right,

In trials of ev’ry kind, praise God

I always find,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

2 Tho' dark the night and clouds

look black and stormy overhead,

And trials of almost ev'ry kind

across my path are spread;

How soon I conquer all,

As to the Lord I call,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

3 When those who once were

dearest friends begin to persecute,

And more who once professed to love,

have silent grown and mute;

I tell Him all my grief,

He quickly sends relief,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

And thus, by frequent little talks,

I gain the victory;

And march along with cheerful song,

enjoying liberty;

With Jesus as my Friend,

I'll prove until the end,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

When man's work is o'er.

Make this a Pentecostal hour,

When hung'ring souls from Thee receive

Pardon, or purity, or pow'r;

Sick with depravity within,

Restless, discouraged, weary ones,

And Thou art here to cleanse from sin;

By stretching forth Thy hand to heal,

Let signs and wonders from the Lord

Here in our midst to-day be done.

In yielded hearts and lives today.

How very far from God;

Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,

Through faith in Jesus' blood.

I am as near as He.

More dear I cannot be;

Such is His love to me.

Since such a God is mine?

He watches o'er me night and day,

And tells me ""Mine is thine.""

1 Father, I know that all my life

Is portioned out for me;

The changes that are sure to come

I do not fear to see;

I ask Thee for a present mink,

Intent on pleasing Thee.

2 I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,

Through constant watching

To meet the glad with joyful

To wipe the weeping eyes,

A heart at leisure from itself,

To soothe and sympathize.

3 I would not have the restless will

That hurries to and fro,

Seeking for some great thing to do,

Or secret thing to know;

I would be treated as a child,

And guided where I go.

4 Wherever in the world I am,

In what-soe'er estate,

I have a fellowship with hearts

To keep and cultivate;

A work of lowly love to do

For Him on whom I wait.

5 I ask Thee for the daily strength,

To none that ask denied,

A mind to blend with outward life,

While keeping at Thy side;

Content to fill a little space,

If Thou be glorified.

6 On every path there is untruth,

That I might patient be;

In every way there is a cross,

That I might lean on Thee.

A lowly heart will find each place

A paradise for me.

7 And if some things I ask not in

My cup of blessing be,

I'd have my spirit filled the more

With grateful love to Thee;

More careful—not to serve Thee much,

But please Thee perfectly.

8 In service which Thy will appoints,

There are no bonds for me;

My inmost heart is taught the truth

That makes Thy children free;

A life of self-renouncing love

Is one of liberty.
