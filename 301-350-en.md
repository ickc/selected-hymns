Thy presence to enjoy

Our entrance now with boldness is,

As we Thy blood employ.

Not by our merit do we stand,

Nor in our righteousness,

Thy blood and righteousness we need;

Their worth we now confess.

2 Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,

Are holy, righteous, good.

We own our sins as crimson are,

We need Thy cleansing blood.

We have no argument, no plea;

No veil our sin can hide.

But, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood

Is to our sin applied!

3 God has not overlooked our sin,

But judged it once for all;

His righteous fury, not on us,

But on His Lamb did fall.

A new and living way is made—

We stand on legal ground;

Our Surety and our Substitute

Has pardon for us found.

4 Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,

Redemption now enjoy;

Thy precious blood again we see,

Its virtue now employ.

Dear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,

Unlimited and free.

Oh, Lamb of God, we’ll sing Thy praise,

Through all eternity!

1 Before the throne of God above

I have a strong, a perfect plea;

A great High Priest, whose Name is Love,

Who ever lives and pleads for me.

2 My name is graven on His hands,

My name is written on His heart;

I know that while in heaven He stands

No tongue can bid me thence depart.

3 When Satan tempts me to despair,

And tells me of the guilt within,

Upward I look, and see Him there

Who made an end of all my sin.

4 Because the sinless Savior died,

My sinful soul is counted free;

For God, the Just, is satisfied

To look on Him and pardon me.

5 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!

My perfect, spotless Righteousness,

The great unchangeable I AM,

The King of glory and of grace.

6 One with Himself, I cannot die;

My soul is purchased by His blood;

My life is hid with Christ on high,

With Christ, my Savior and my God.

336 8.8.8.8. D.

1 Complete in Thee! no work of mine

May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine;

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,

And I am now cornplete in Thee.

Yea, justified! O blessed thought!

And sanctified! Salvation wrought!

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,

And glorified, I too, shall be!

2 Complete in Thee—no more shall sin,

Thy grace hath conquered, reign within;

Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee,

And I shall stand complete in Thee.

3 Complete in Thee—each want supplied,

And no good thing to me denied;

Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,

I ask no more, complete in Thee.

4 Dear Savior! when before Thy bar

All tribes and tongues assembled are,

Among Thy chosen will I be,

At Thy right hand—complete in Thee.

337 8.6.8.6.D.

1 My faith has found a resting place,

Not in device nor creed;

I trust the Ever living One,

His wounds for me shall plead.

I need no other argument,

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,

And that He died for me.

2 Enough for me that Jesus saves,

This ends my fear and doubt;

A sinful soul I come to Him,

He’ll never cast me out.

3 My heart is leaning on the Word,

The written Word of God,

Salvation by my Savior’s name,

Salvation through His blood.

4 My great Physician heals the sick,

The lost He came to save;

For me His precious blood He shed,

For me His life He gave.

338 10.9.10.9. with chorus

1 What a fellowship, what a joy divine.

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

Leaning, leaning,

Safe and secure from all alarms;

Leaning, leaning,

Leaning on the Ever lasting Arms.

2 O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

O how bright the path grows from day to day,

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

3 What have I to dread, what have I to fear,

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

I have peace complete with my Lord so near,

Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

339 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1 I know not why God’s wondrous grace

To me He hath made known,

Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love

Redeemed me for His own.

But “I know Whom I have believed

And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed

Unto Him against that day.”

2 I know not how this saving faith

To me He did impart,

Nor how believing in His word

Wrought peace within my heart.

3 I know not how the Spirit moves,

Convincing men of sin,

Revealing Jesus through the Word,

Creating faith in Him.

4 I know not what of good or ill

May be reserved for me,

Of weary ways or golden days,

Before His face I see.

5 I know not when my Lord may come,

At night or noon-day fair,

Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,

Or “meet Him in the air.”

340 10.9.10.9. with chorus

1 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?

When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,

Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

We have an anchor that keeps the soul

Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,

Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,

Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love.

2 It is safely moored, ‘twill the storm withstand,

For ’tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;

And the cables passed from His heart to mine,

Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

3 It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,

When the breakers have told the reef is near;

Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,

Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.

4 It will surely hold in the floods of death,

When the waters cold chill our latest breath;

On the rising tide it can never fail,

While our hopes abide within the veil.

341 6.6.8.6

1 I hear the words of love,

I gaze upon the blood,

I see the mighty sacrifice,

And I have peace with God.

2 ‘Tis everlasting peace!

Sure as Jehovah’s Name,

’Tis stable as His steadfast throne,

For evermore the same.

3 The clouds may go and come,

And storms may sweep my sky;

This blood-sealed friendship changes not,

The Cross is ever nigh.

4 My love is ofttimes low,

My joy still ebbs and flows,

But peace with Him remains the same,

No change my Savior knows.

5 I change, He changes not;

The Christ can never die;

His love, not mine, the resting-place,

His truth, not mine, the tie.

6 The Cross still stands unchanged,

Though heaven is now His home;

The mighty stone is rolled away,

But yonder is His tomb!

7 And yonder is my peace,

The grave of all my woes!

I know the Son of God has come,

I know He died and rose.

8 I know He liveth now

At God’s right hand above;

I know the throne on which He sits,

I know His truth and love!

342 11.8.11.8. with chorus

1 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

A wonderful Savior to me:

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,

Where rivers of pleasure I see.

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life in the depths of His love,

And covers me there with His hand,

And covers me there with his hand.

2 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

He taketh my burden away;

He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,

He giveth me strength as my day.

3 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,

And, filled with his fulness divine,

I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,

For such a Redeemer as mine!

4 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise

To meet Him in clouds of the sky,

His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,

I’ll shout with the millions on high.

343 8.7.8.7. D.

1 I will sing the wondrous story

Of the Christ who died for me,

How He left His home in glory

For the cross of Calvary.

Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story

Of the Christ who died for me,

Sing it in the light of glory,

Sing it through eternity.

2 I was lost, but Jesus found me,

Found the sheep that went astray,

Threw His loving arms around me,

Drew me back into His way.

3 I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;

Faint was I from many a fall;

Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,

But He freed me from them all.

4 Days of darkness still come o’er me,

Sorrow’s paths I often tread,

But the Savior still is with me;

By His hand I’m safely led.

344 8.10.10.10.

1 Wounded for me, wounded for me,

There on the cross He was wounded for me;

Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,

All because Jesus was wounded for me.

2 Dying for me, dying for me,

There on the cross He was dying for me;

Now in His death my redemption I see,

All because Jesus was dying for me.

3 Risen for me, risen for me,

Up from the grave He has risen for me;

Now evermore from death’s sting I am free,

All because Jesus has risen for me.

4 Living for me, living for me,

Up in the skies He is living for me;

Daily He’s pleading and praying for me,

All because Jesus is living for me.

5 Coming for me, coming for me,

Soon in the air He is coming for me;

Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,

Oh, how I praise Him! He’s coming for me.

345 11.11.11.11.

1 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,

Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!

What more can He say than to you He hath said,

To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

2 “Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,

For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;

I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,

Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

3 “When through the deep waters I call thee to go,

The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;

For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,

And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

4 “When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,

My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;

The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design

Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

5 “E’en down to old age all My people shall prove

My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;

And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,

Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.

6 “The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,

I will not, I will not desert to his foes;

That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,

I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!”

346 11.11.11.9. with chorus

1 Standing on the promises of Christ my king,

Through eternal ages let His praises ring,

Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,

Standing on the promises of God.

Standing, standing,

Standing on the promises of God my Savior;

Standing, standing,

I’m standing on the promises of God.

2 Standing on the promises that cannot fail,

When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,

By the living Word of God I shall prevail,

Standing on the promises of God.

3 Standing on the promises I now can see

Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;

Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,

Standing on the promises of God.

4 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,

Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,

Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,

Standing on the promises of God.

5 Standing on the promises I shall not fall,

List’ning ev’ry moment to the Spirit’s call,

Resting in my Savior as my All in all,

Standing on the promises of God.

347 11.8.11.9. with chorus

1 When peace like a river attendeth my way,

When sorrows like sea billows roll;

Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,

“It is well, it is well with my soul!”

It is well with my soul!

It is well, it is well with my soul!

2 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,

Let this blest assurance control,

That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,

And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

3 My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought—

My sin, not in part, but the whole,

Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

4 For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;

If dark hours about me shall roll,

No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life

Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

5 And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,

The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,

The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,

“Even so”—it is well with my soul.

348 10.10.10.10.

1 Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me,

As some strong tide it preseth on its way,

Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul,

Yearning to sweep all barriers away.

2 Shall I not yield to that constraining power?

Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?

My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me,

Life cannot be as it hath hither been.

3 Break through my nature, mighty heavenly love,

Clear every avenue of thought and brain,

Flood my affections, purify my will,

Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.

4 Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God,

Forth from my life, spontaneous and free,

Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace,

Loving, because God loved, eternally.

349 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus

1 Let me love Thee, Thou art claiming

Every feeling of my soul;

Let that love in pow’r prevailing,

Render Thee my life, my all;

For life’s burdens they are easy,

And life’s sorrows lose their sting,

If they’re carried, Lord, to please Thee,

If their pain Thy smile should win.

Let me love Thee, Savior, Take my heart forever,

Nothing but Thy favor My soul can satisfy.

2 Let me love Thee, come revealing

All Thy love has done for me;

Help my heart, so unbelieving,

By the sight of Calvary:

Let me see Thy love despising

All the shame my sins had brought;

By Thy torments realizing

What a price my pardon bought.

3 Let me love Thee, I am gladdest

When I’m loving Thee, the best;

For in sunshine or in sadness

I can find in Thee a rest;

But without Thee life is fading,

Treasureless its choicest flowers;

Taken are its gifts eternal;

Left, its empty passing hours.

4 Let me love Thee, love is mighty,

Swaying realms of deed and thought;

By it I shall walk uprightly,

I shall serve Thee as I ought:

Love will soften every sorrow,

Love will lighten every care,

Love unquestioning will follow,

Love will triumph, love will dare.

350 8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6.

1 O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!

Forgive me if I say,

For very love, Thy sacred name

A thousand times a day.

O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;

I rest in Thee, whate’er betide;

Thy gracious smile is my reward;

I love, I love Thee, Lord.!

2 I love Thee so I know not how

My transports to control;

Thy love is like a burning fire

Within my very soul.

3 For Thou to me art all in all;

My honor and my wealth;

My heart’s desire, my body’s strength,

My soul’s eternal health.

4 Burn, bum, O love, within my heart,

Burn fiercely night and day,

Till all the dross of earthly loves

Is burned, and burned away.

5 O light in darkness, joy in grief,

O heaven’s life on earth;

Jesus, my love, my treasure, who

Can tell what Thou art worth?

6 What limit is them to this love?

Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?

On, on! our Lord is sweeter far

Today than yesterday.
