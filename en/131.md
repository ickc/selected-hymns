# 131 8.8.8.8.

1.  Jesus shall reign where’er the sun

Doth his successive journeys run;

His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,

Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

2.  To Him shall endless prayer be made,

The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,

His name like sweet perfume shall rise

With every morning sacrifice,

3.  People and realms of every tongue

Dwell on His love with sweetest song;

And infant voices shall proclaim

Their early blessings on His name.

4.  Blessings abound where’er He reigns:

And princes throng to crown His head,

The weary find eternal rest,

And all the sons of want are blest.

5.  Where He displays His healing power

Death and the curse are known no more;

In Him the tribes of Adam boast

More blessings than their father lost.

6.  Let every creature rise and bring

Peculiar honors to our King;

Angels descend with songs again,

And earth repeat the loud Amen.
