# 429 5.4.5.4.D.

1.  Have Thine own way, Lord,

Have Thine own way; Thou art the Potter,

I am the clay.

Mould me and make me After Thy will,

While I am waiting, Yielded and still.

2.  Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;

Search me and try me, Master, today.

Whiter than snow, Lord, Wash me just now,

As in Thy presence Humbly I bow.

3.  Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;

Wounded and weary, Help me, I pray.

Power, all power, Surely is Thine,

Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.

4.  Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;

Hold oâ€™er my being Absolute sway.

Fill with Thy Spirit Till all shall see

Christ only, always, Living in me.
