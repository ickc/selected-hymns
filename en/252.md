# 252 12.11.12.12

1.  We gather together to eat the Lord’s supper:

By eating and drinking, our oneness we show.

His presence possessing, our oneness confessing,

‘Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.

2.  We’re eating the bread of His body once broken

As now we’re enjoying His Body made one:

One loaf on the table-one Body, we’re able

To testify to all that the Lord’s made us one.

3.  We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,

The church’s true fellowship of the Lord’s blood;

Redeemed by believing, all saints we’re receiving,

All those who through redemption have come unto God.

4.  Oh, what can we say now except “Hallelujah!”

For such a reality given to us.

Thy blood we’re employing, Thy Body enjoying;

Thus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious.
