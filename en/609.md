# 609 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus

1.  Share thy handful with the stranger;

Bid the Prophet to thy board;

No resources are in danger

Whose exchequer is the Lord.

Daily new demands await thee,

Daily new supplies are sent;

He alone who doth create thee

Can secure thy nourishment.

Giving, giving, o’er and o’er,

Still you’ll find one handful more.

Loving is the truest living;

God will double all thy store.

2.  Trust! the Lord will not deny thee,

Ev’ry longing shall be stilled;

Trust! the cruse will yet supply thee,

Never empty, never filled.

Should the lilies lack apparel?

Should the ravens cry in vain?

Even then the widow’s barrel

Shall its handful still retain.

3.  Why shouldst thou forecast the morrow?

Take with gladness while you may;

Why, dismayed, forbodings borrow?

See! thou hast enough today;

’Tis by loving that thou livest,

Spending doth not waste thy store,

Tho’ it seems the last thou givest,

There is, aye, one handful more.
