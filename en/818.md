# 818 8.8.8.6. with chorus

1.  Amid the trials that I meet,

Amid the thorns that pierce my feet,

One thought remains supremely sweetâ€”

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

What need I fear when Thou art near,

And thinkest, Lord, of me!

2.  The cares of life come thronging fast,

Upon my soul their shadows cast;

Their gloom reminds my heart at last

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

3.  Let shadows come, let shadows go,

Let life be bright, or dark with woe,

I am content, for this I know

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
