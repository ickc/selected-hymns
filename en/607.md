# 607 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  Can you be obedient To the Lord of all,\
Though the earth should totter, Though the heav’ns should fall?\
Face e’en a disaster With a faith-filled heart,\
Knowing naught can harm him Who with Christ will start?

2.  Can you be obedient To the Lord you serve,\
Never even flinch, friend, Never even swerve;\
Though your next step onward Seem to lead to death?\
Can you then obey Him Without bated breath?

3.  Can you trust your Leader When He bids you go

Right into a battle With a mighty foe?

Can you step up briskly And with joy obey?

Can you fight the battle, Till the end of day?

4.  Can you? Then beloved, Christ just waits for you;

Listen for His orders, Glad His will to do;

Then when soldiers muster At the set of sun,

And your name is mentioned, Christ will say, “Well done.”
