1.  Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord, God Almighty!

Unto everlasting days our song shall rise to Thee;

Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty!

God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

2.  Holy, Holy, Holy! all the saints adore Thee;

Heavenâ€™s elders cast their crowns down by the glassy sea;

Cherubim and seraphim worship too before Thee,

Who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

3.  Holy, Holy, Holy! though the darkness hide Thee,

Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,

Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,

Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
