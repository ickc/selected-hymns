1.  On Calvary’s brow my Savior died

‘Twas there my Lord was crucified;

‘Twas on the cross He bled for me

And purchased there my pardon free.

O Calvary! dark Calvary!

Where Jesus shed His blood for me;

O Calvary! blest Calvary!

‘Twas there my Savior died for me.

2.  ‘Mid rending rocks and darkening skies

My Savior bows His head and dies;

The opening veil reveals the way

To life divine and endless day.

3.  O Jesus, Lord, how can it be

That Thou shouldst give Thy life for me,

To bear the cross and agony

In that dread hour on Calvary!
