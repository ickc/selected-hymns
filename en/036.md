1.  Father, Thy Son beloved leads our praise

After the banquet feast is had and done;

How dear, how sweet to Thee the praise He leads,

And in His praises joining we are one.

2.  Father, we need no goodness more than Thee,

Nor do we seek a love thatâ€™s less than Thine;

How we adore Thee now that here we know

Thy searchless, uncreated life divine.

3.  Father, within Thy love our love to Thee

Grows, far transcending all our earthly ties;

Thine own dear love in power leads our hearts

Where Thine own presence deeply satisfies.

4.  Father, by joining with Thy Son beloved,

We all with gladness praise Thee now again;

Joyfully feasting on Thy holy love,

Tasting, as sons, the sweetness of Thy name.
