# 117 8.7.8.7.

1.  Hark! Ten thousand voices crying,

“Lamb of God!” with one accord;

Thousand thousand saints replying,

Wake at once the echo’ng chord.

2.  “Praise the Lamb!” the chorus waking,

All in heav’n together throng;

Loud and far each tongue partaking

Rolls around the endless song.

3.  Grateful incense this, ascending

Ever to the Father’s throne;

Every knee to Jesus bending,

All the mind in heav’n is one.

4.  All the Father’s counsels claiming

Equal honors to the Son,

All the Son’s effulgence beaming,

Makes the Father’s glory known.

5.  By the Spirit all pervading,

Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,

Crowned with light and joy unfading,

Hail Him as the great “I AM.”

6.  Joyful now the new creation

Rests in undisturbed repose,

Blest in Jesus’ full salvation,

Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.

7.  Hark! the heavenly notes again!

Loudly swells the song of praise;

Through creation’s vault, Amen!

Amen! responsive joy doth raise.
