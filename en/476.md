1.  We have seen Christ is reality:

But it’s not sufficient just to see:

He in our experience must be

Everything to us.

We in prayer behold Him face to face,

In the Word and meetings know His grace;

But in daily life, in every place,

What is He to us?

Hallelujah! By His light we see

Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be

If we’ll only turn to Him at every time,

in every day,

Every thing, in every way and—

Be specific for reality!

And be done with generality!

If we’ll just apply Him, we will see He’s everything to us.

2.  Life is full of opportunities

Ordered by our Father’s hand: we see

Everything’s the best that it could be,

So let’s gain Christ!

Christ our content and reality

To shine out from us unceasingly:

He must have a way in you and me,

He must have a way.

Hallelujah! In the body we

Bear the death of Christ continually:

Thus His life comes forth for all to see as

The outer man is broken down,

The inner man is shining so that—

In these earthen vessels men can see

There’s the treasure of reality!

Thus the gospel’s glorious light will be

Shining out from us.

Not just doctrines and theology,

But the content of reality:

Christ as everything in you and me,

He’s everything to us!
