# 765 8.6.8.6.

1.  Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,

Thou Giver of all good!

E’en heav’n itself no richer knows

Than Jesus and His blood.

2.  Faith, too, that trusts the blood through grace,

From that same love we gain;

Else, sweetly as it suits our case,

The gift had been in vain.

3.  O Love divine, Thou vast abyss!

Our sins buried in Thee,

Cover'd is our unrighteousness,

From all debts we are free.

4.  In Jesus' blood our hearts can trace

The footprints of Thy love,

And know the riches of Thy grace,

The holy righteousness.

5.  Though heart may fail and flesh decay,

On firm ground we remain,

When earth and heav'n shall pass away,

Our anchor shall sustain.

6.  Until that day, we then shall prove,

The full worth of Thy love.

But here on earth, my life still needs

Thy great sustaining power.

7.  We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,

To Thee our all we owe;

The precious Saviour, and the power

That makes Him precious too.
