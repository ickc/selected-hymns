# 104 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus

1.  Christ is risen! Hallelujah!

Risen our victorious Head;

Sing His praises; Hallelujah!

Christ is risen from the dead.

Gratefully our hearts adore Him,

As His light once more appears;

Bowing down in joy before Him,

Rising up from griefs and tears.

Christ is risen: Hallelujah!

Risen our victorious Head;

Sing His praises; Hallelujah!

Christ is risen from the dead.

2.  Christ is risen! All the sadness

Of His earthly life is o’er;

Through the open gates of gladness

He returns to life once more;

Death and hell before Him bending,

He doth rise the Victor now,

Angels on His steps attending,

Glory round His wounded brow.

3.  Christ is risen! Henceforth never

Death nor hell shall us enthrall;

We are Christ’s, in Him forever

We have triumphed over all;

All the doubting and dejection

Of our trembling hearts have ceased,

’Tis His day of resurrection;

Let us rise and keep the feast.
