1.  Full salvation! Full salvation!

Lo, the fountain opened wide,

Streams through ev’ry land and nation

From the Savior’s wounded side.

Full Salvation! Full salvation!

Streams an endless crimson tide,

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  Oh, the glorious revelation!

See the cleansing current flow,

Washing stains of condemnation

Whiter than the driven snow:

Full salvation! Full salvation!

Oh, the rapturous bliss to know.

3.  Love’s resistless current sweeping

All the regions deep within;

Thought, and wish, and senses keeping

Now, and every instant, clean:

Full salvation! Full salvation!

From the guilt and power of sin.

4.  Life immortal, Christ descending,

Lo! my heart the Spirit’s shrine:

God and man in oneness blending,

Oh, what fellowship is mine!

Full salvation! Full salvation!

Raised in Christ to life divine!

5.  Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,

Fear and shame are mine no more;

Faith knows naught of dark tomorrow,

For my Savior goes before:

Full salvation! Full salvation!

Full and free for evermore!
