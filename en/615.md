# 615 11.9.11.9. with chorus

1.  There’s a race for us to run—Hallelujah,

And a way for us the race to win.

To all those who have begun—Hallelujah,

God has spoken, “Look away to Him!”

Look away! O look away!

Look to Jesus now today!

Look away from everything unto Jesus,

Look away from everything to Him!

2.  Look away from all around—Hallelujah,

Look away from all the strife and din;

Look away where peace is found—Hallelujah,

Look away from everything to Him.

3.  Look away from fickle soul—Hallelujah,

Look away from failing self within;

Look away toward the goal—Hallelujah,

Look away from everything to Him.

4.  Look away from all the past—Hallelujah,

Look away from both the good and sin;

To the living One hold fast—Hallelujah,

Look away from everything to Him.

5.  Look away into His face—Hallelujah,

He who’ll finish what He did begin.

O what grace to run the race—Hallelujah—

We obtain by looking off to Him!
