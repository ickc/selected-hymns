1.  Work, for the night is coming,

Work thru the morning hours;

Work while the dew is sparkling,

Work ‘mid springing flow’rs.

Work when the day grows brighter,

Work in the glowing sun;

Work, for the night is coming,

When man’s work is done.

2.  Work, for the night is coming,

Work thru the sunny noon;

Fill brightest hours with labor—

Rest comes sure and soon.

Give ev'ry flying minute

Something to keep in store;

Work, for the night is coming,

When man works no more.

3.  Work, for the night is coming,

Under the sunset skies:

While their bright tints are glowing,

Work, for daylight flies.

Work till the last beam fadeth,

Fadeth to shine no more;

Work, while the night is dark'ning,

When man's work is o'er.
