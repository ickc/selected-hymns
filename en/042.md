# 042 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Thou art the everlasting Word,

The Father’s only Son,

God manifestly seen and heard,

And heav’n’s beloved One.

Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,

That ev’ry knee to Thee should bow!

2.  In Thee, most perfectly expressed,

The Father’s glories shine,

Of the full Deity possessed,

Eternally Divine!

3.  True image of the Infinite,

Whose essence is concealed;

Brightness of uncreated light,

The heart of God revealed.

4.  But the high myst’ries of His name

The creature’s grasp transcend;

The Father only \[glorious claim\]!

The Son can comprehend.

5.  Thro’out the universe of bliss,

The center Thou, and Sun,

Th’ eternal theme of praise is this,

To heav’n’s beloved One.
