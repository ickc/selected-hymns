1.  Face to face with Christ, my Savior,

Face to face—what will it be?

When with rapture I behold Him,

Jesus Christ who died for me.

Face to face I shall behold Him,

Far beyond the starry sky;

Face to face in all His glory,

I shall see Him by and by!

2.  Only faintly now, I see Him,

With the darkling veil between,

But a blessed day is coming,

When His glory shall be seen.

3.  What rejoicing in His presence,

When are banished grief and pain;

When the crooked ways are straightened,

And the dark things shall be plain.

4.  Face to face! O blissful moment!

Face to face—to see and know;

Face to face with my Redeemer,

Jesus Christ who loves me so.
