# 207 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  In the mighty Name of Jesus,

When we bow before the Throne,

Many deadly foes are vanquished,

Many victories are won.

Mighty Name! Mighty Name!

In that Name alone we win.

Mighty Name! Mighty Name!

Conquering Satan, death and sin.

2.  When we plead the Name of Jesus,

Satan and his hosts must flee.

Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!

In Thy Name is victory.

3.  Soon shall come the blessed moment

When the battle shall be won,

When the Mighty Name of Jesus

Shall exalt us to the Throne.
