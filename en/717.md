1.  In tenderness He sought me,

Weary and sick with sin,

And on His shoulders brought me

Into His flock again.

While angels in His presence sang

Until the courts of heaven rang.

Oh, the love that sought me!

Oh, the blood that bought me!

Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,

Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

2.  He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,

And poured in oil and wine;

He whispered to assure me,

“I’ve found thee, thou art Mine:”

I never heard a sweeter voice,

It made my aching heart rejoice.

3.  He pointed to the nail-prints,

For me His blood was shed;

A mocking crown so thorny,

Was placed upon His head:

I wondered what He saw in me,

To suffer such deep agony.
