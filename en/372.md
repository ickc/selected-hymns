# 372 8.6.8.6.

1.  Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,

In ev ‘ry part with praise,

That my whole being may proclaim

Thy being and Thy ways.

2.  Not for the lip of praise alone,

Nor e’en the praising heart,

I ask, but for a life made up

Of praise in every part:

3.  Fill every part of me with praise;

Let all my being speak

Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,

Poor though I be and weak.

4.  Praise in the common things of life,

Its goings out and in;

Praise in each duty and each deed,

However small and mean.

5.  So shall no part of day or night

From sacredness be free,

But all my life, in every step,

Be fellowship with Thee.
