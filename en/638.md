# 638 8.8.8.8.8.8. with repeat (Repeat last two lines of each stanza)

1.  ”A little while!” Our Lord shall come,

And we shall wander here no more;

He’ll take us to our Father’s home,

Where He for us has gone before—

To dwell with Him, to see His face,

And sing the glories of His grace.

2.  ""A little while”—He’ll come again;

Let us the precious hours redeem;

Our only grief to give Him pain,

Our joy to serve and follow Him.

Watching and ready may we be,

As those that wait their Lord to see.

3.  ""A little while”—’twill soon be past,

Why should we shun the promised cross?

O let us in His footsteps haste,

Counting for Him all else but loss;

For how will recompense His smile

The suff’rings of this “little while.”

4.  ""A little while”—come, Savior, come!

For Thee Thy bride has tarried long;

Take Thy poor waiting pilgrims home,

To sing the new eternal song,

To see Thy glory, and to be

In ev’rything conformed to Thee!
