# 343 8.7.8.7. D.

1.  I will sing the wondrous story

Of the Christ who died for me,

How He left His home in glory

For the cross of Calvary.

Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story

Of the Christ who died for me,

Sing it in the light of glory,

Sing it through eternity.

2.  I was lost, but Jesus found me,

Found the sheep that went astray,

Threw His loving arms around me,

Drew me back into His way.

3.  I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;

Faint was I from many a fall;

Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,

But He freed me from them all.

4.  Days of darkness still come o’er me,

Sorrow’s paths I often tread,

But the Savior still is with me;

By His hand I’m safely led.
