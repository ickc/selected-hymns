1 Jesus, cast a look on me;

Give me sweet simplicity;

Make me poor, and keep me low,

Seeking only Thee to know.

2 Weaned from all my lordly self,

Weaned from all the miser's pelf,

Weaned from all the scorner's ways,

Weaned from all the lust of praise.

3 All that feeds my busy pride,

Cast it evermore aside;

Bid my will to Thine submit,

Lay me humbly at Thy feet.

4 Make me like a little child,

Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;

Seeing only in Thy light,

Walking only in Thy might;

5 Leaning on Thy loving breast,

Where a weary soul may rest;

Feeling well the peace of God

Flowing from Thy precious blood.

6 In this posture let me live,

And hosannas daily give;

In this temper let me die,

And hosannas ever cry.

1 Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?

Is not thine a captured heart?

Chief among ten thousand own Him;

Joyful choose the better part.

Captivated by His beauty,

Worthy tribute haste to bring;

Let His peerless worth constrain thee,

Crown Him now unrivaled King.

2 Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,

Lovely things of time and sense;

Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,

Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

3 What has stripped the seeming beauty

From the idols of the earth?

Not a sense of right or duty,

But the sight of peerless worth.

4 Not the crushing of those idols,

With its bitter void and smart;

But the beaming of His beauty,

The unveiling of His heart.

5 Who extinguishes their taper

Till they hail the rising sun?

Who discards the garb of winter

Till the summer has begun?

6 ’Tis that look that melted Peter,

’Tis that face that Stephen saw,

’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,

Can alone from idols draw:

7 Draw and win and fill completely,\
Till the cup o’erflow the brim;\
What have we to do with idols\
Who have companied with Him?

1 How can I ever stay away

And grieve Thy Spirit all the day

While Thou dost wait for me?

I now am willing to return,

And wait no longer, for I yearn

Henceforth to follow Thee.

2 I offer now without reserve

All that I am and all I have

Thy purpose to fulfill.

Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,

That henceforth I may only seek

To do the Father's will.

3 When I look back, what grief and shame

That I've brought none to trust Thy name,

Thy word I've locked within.

Oh, may the Lord anointing give

And richly through my being live,

That I may speak of Him.

Exceeding e'en a friend my place;

I fain would be His bride.

I'd share His life and suffer loss,

Accepting willingly the cross,

With Him identified.

Lord, here I take my cross now to follow Thee,

Worldly gain, empty fame are but dross to me.

Men may sneer, men may jeer, pain may come or stay;

Naught can cause me to stray from the narrow way.

Thro’ His word, by His grace, I would faithful be;

Till at last I reach home, there’s a crown for me,

A bright crown for me, yes, a crown for me.

Most faithful at all hours.

Changeless as years go by;

He is most dear to me,

No greater love have I.

1 Give up the world, Christ to obtain,

He is your heart's very need;

What else can you desire or seek?

All things are empty indeed!

He is so rich, He is so full,

He can fulfill all your needs!

He is so good, He is so sweet,

All your desire He exceeds!

2 Give up the world, Christ to obtain,

He is the One you require;

Once you receive this glorious Christ,

Never the rest you'll desire.

3 Though very great is all the world,

And very small is your heart,

Yet the great world with all its wealth

Never can fill your small heart.

4 If you have Christ, you have all joys;

Without this Christ, only pains;

Where there is Christ there morning is;

Where He is not, night remains.

What can I want beside?

Where heav'nly pasture grows,

Where living waters gently pass

And full salvation flows.

Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;

His love the banner, His affection shown

Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

I am a lily and my Shepherd He;

May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,

Him on the mountains as a hart I'd see.

5 Myrrh of the death with Him and frankincense,

The resurrection, permeate my heart;

North wind awake, and let the south wind blow,

Make my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.

As a pure lily in His presence be,

His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,

He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.

Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;

For my Beloved, all to please His heart,

For my Beloved, that His life be shown.

Ne'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced

My wearied eyelids gently steep,

Be my last thought how sweet to rest

Forever on my Savior's breast.

3 Abide with me from mom till eve,

For without Thee I cannot live;

Abide with me when night is nigh,

For without Thee I dare not die.

Ere through the World our way we take;

Till in the ocean of Thy love

We lose ourselves in Thee above.

Step by step and day by day;

Stepping in His very footprints,

Walking with Him all the way.

Step by step, step by step,

I would walk with Jesus,

All the day, all the way,

Keeping Step with Jesus.

2 'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,

Leaning hard upon His arm,

Following closely where He leads us,

None can hurt and naught can harm.

3 Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,

Just a moment at a time,

Heights I have not wings to soar to,

Step by step my feet can climb.

4 All the way I'll walk with Jesus,

Through the sunshine, through the gloom,

Though His blood-marked steps may lead me

To the garden, to the tomb.

5 Here a while we walk with Jesus,

But the time will not be long

Till the night shall change to morning,

And the sorrow into song.

6 Then, with all who walked with Jesus,

We shall walk with Him in white,

While He turns our grief to gladness,

And our darkness into light.

Step by step, and day by day;

Stepping in Thy very footprints,

Walking with Thee all the way.

And draws the heart from earth,

And sickens it of passing shows

And dissipating mirth!

2 'Tis not enough to save our souls,

To shun th' eternal fires;

The thought of God will rouse the heart

To more sublime desires.

3 God only is the creature's home,

Though rough and straight the road;

Yet nothing less can satisfy

The love that longs for God.

4 Oh, utter but the Name of God

Down in your heart of hearts,

And see how from the world at once

All tempting light departs.

5 A trusting heart, a yearning eye,

Can win their way above;

If mountains can be moved by faith,

Is there less power in love?

6 How little of that road, my soul!

How little hast thou gone!

Take heart, and let the thought of God

Allure thee further on.

7 The freedom from all willful sin,

The Christian's daily task;

Oh! these are graces far below

What longing love would ask!

8 The perfect way is hard to flesh;

It is not hard to love;

If thou wert sick for want of God,

How swiftly wouldst thou move!

9 Then keep thy conscience sensitive;

No inward token miss:

And go where grace entices thee—

Perfection lies in this.

1 There were ninety and nine that safely lay

In the shelter of the flock,

But one was out on the hills away,

Far off in the cold and dark;

Away on the mountains wild and bare,

Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

2 “Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;

Are they not enough for Thee?”

But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine

Has wandered away from Me;

And although the road be rough and steep,

I go to the desert to find My sheep.”

3 But none of the ransomed ever knew

How deep were the waters crossed;

Nor how dark was the night

which the Lord passed through

Ere He found His sheep that was lost.

Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry—

All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.

4 “Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way

That mark out the mountain’s track?”

“They were shed for one who had gone astray

Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”

“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?”

“They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.”

5 And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,

And up from the rocky steep,

There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,

“Rejoice! I have found My sheep!”

And the angels echoed around the throne,

“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!”
