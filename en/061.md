1.  Name of Jesus! highest Name!

Name that earth and heav’n adore!

From the heart of God it came,

Leads me to God’s heart once more.

2.  Name of Jesus! living tide!

Days of drought for me are past;

How much more than satisfied

Are the thirsty lips at last!

3.  Name of Jesus! dearest Name!

Bread of heav’n, and balm of love,

Oil of gladness, surest claim

To the treasures stored above.

4.  Only Jesus! fairest Name!

Life and rest and peace and bliss;

Jesus, evermore the same,

He is mine and I am His!
