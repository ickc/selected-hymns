# 712 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  Jesus, I will trust Thee,

Trust Thee with my soul,

Guilty, lost and helpless,

Thou canst make me whole:

There is none in heaven

Or on earth like Thee:

Thou hast died for sinners,

Therefore, Lord, for me.

Jesus, I will trust Thee,

Trust Thee with my soul,

Guilty, lost and helpless,

Thou canst make me whole.

2.  Jesus, I must trust Thee,

Pondering Thy ways;

Full of love and mercy

All Thine earthly days:

Sinners gathered round Thee,

Lepers sought Thy face:

None too vile or loathsome

For a Savior’s grace.

3.  Jesus, I can trust Thee,

Trust Thy written Word,

Though Thy voice of pity

I have never heard:

When Thy Spirit teacheth,

To my taste how sweet!

Only may I hearken,

Sitting at Thy feet.

4.  Jesus, I do trust Thee,

Trust without a doubt;

Whosoever cometh

Thou wilt not cast out:

Faithful is Thy promise,

Precious is Thy blood:

These my soul’s salvation,

Thou my Savior God!
