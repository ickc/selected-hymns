# 672 6.6.6.6. with chorus

1.  I hear the Savior say,

“Thy strength indeed is small,

Child of weakness, watch and pray,

Find in Me thine all in all.”

Jesus paid it all,

All to Him I owe;

Sin had left a crimson stain,

He washed it white as snow.

2.  Lord, now indeed I find

Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,

Can change the leper’s spots,

And melt the heart of stone.

3.  For nothing good have I

Whereby Thy grace to claim—

I’ll wash my garments white

In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.

4.  And when, before the throne,

I stand in Him complete,

“Jesus died my soul to save,”

My lips shall still repeat.
