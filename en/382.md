# 382 8.8.8.8. with chorus

1.  More about Jesus would I know,

More of His grace to others show;

More of His saving fullness see,

More of His love who died for me.

More, more about Jesus,

More, more about Jesus;

More of His saving fullness see,

More of His love who died for me.

2.  More about Jesus let me learn,\
More of His holy will discern;\
Spirit of God my teacher be,\
Showing the things of Christ to me.

3.  More about Jesus; in His Word,

Holding communion with my Lord;

Hearing His voice in every line,

Making each faithful saying mine.

4.  More about Jesus; on His throne,

Riches in glory all His own;

More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase;

More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
