# 026 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  We praise Thee, glorious Father,

As objects of Thy grace,

Who for Thine own heart’s pleasure

Are now before Thy face:

Thy sons marked out for glory

Known from eternity—

With Christ Thy Well-beloved,

Object supreme to Thee.

2.  Who else but Thee, O Father,

Could in Thine only Son

So bless us with Thy Spirit,

And have us for Thine own?

Soon shall we be forever

With Christ in glory; then

We’ll shine in His blest image

Eternally, Amen!
