# 586 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  Like a river, glorious

Is Godâ€™s perfect peace,

Over all victorious

In its bright increase;

Perfect, yet it floweth

Fuller every day,

Perfect, yet it groweth

Deeper all the way.

Stayed upon Christ Jesus,

Hearts are fully blest;

Finding, as He promised,

Perfect peace and rest.

2.  Hidden in the hollow Of His blessed hand,

Never foe can follow, Never traitor stand;

Not a surge of worry, Not a shade of care,

Not a blast of hurry Touch the spirit there.

3.  Every joy or trial Falleth from above,

Traced upon our dial By the Sun of Love.

We may trust Him fully All for us to do;

They who trust Him wholly Find Him wholly true.
