# 178 6.6.6.6.D. with chorus

1.  God sent His mighty pow’r

To this poor, sinful heart,

To keep me every hour,

And needful grace impart;

And since His Spirit came,

To take supreme control,

The love-enkindled flame

Is burning in my soul.

’Tis burning in my soul,

’Tis burning in my soul;

The fire of heav’nly love is

burning in my soul;

The Holy Spirit came,

All glory to His name!

The fire of heav’nly love is

burning in my soul.

2.  Before the cross I bow,

Upon the altar lay

A willing off’ring now,

My all from day to day.

My Savior paid the price,

My name He sweetly calls;

Upon the sacrifice

The fire from heaven falls.

3.  No good that I have done,

His promise I embrace;

Accepted in the Son,

He saves me by His grace.

All glory be to God!

Let hallelujahs roll;

His love is shed abroad,

The fire is in my soul.
