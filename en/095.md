# 095 6.6.8.6.

1.  Not all the blood of beasts,

On Jewish altars slain,

Could give the guilty conscience peace,

Or wash away its stain.

2.  But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,

Takes all our sins away;

A sacrifice of nobler name,

And richer blood than they.

3.  My faith would lay her hand

On that dear head of Thine,

While like a penitent I stand,

And there confess my sin.

4.  My soul looks back to see

The burdens Thou didst bear

When hanging on the cursed tree,

And knows her guilt was there.

5.  Believing, we rejoice

To see the curse remove;

We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,

And sing His bleeding love.
