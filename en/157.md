1.  Glory be to Him who loved us,

Washed us from each sinful stain;

Glory be to Him who made us

Priests and kings with Him to reign;

Glory, worship, laud and blessing

To the Lamb who once was slain.

2.  Glory, worship, laud and blessing,

Thus the choir triumphant sings;

Honor, riches, power, dominion,

Thus its praise creation brings;

Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,

Lord of lords, and King of kings.

3.  Glory to the King of angels,

Glory to the Churchâ€™s King,

Glory to the King of nations,

Heaven and earth His praises sing:

Glory ever and forever

To the King of Glory bring.
