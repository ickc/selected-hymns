# 325 12.8.2.9. with chorus

1.  There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,

A peace it can not take away;

Tho’ the trials of life may surround like a cloud,

I’ve a peace that has come there to stay!

Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;

Constantly abiding, rapture divine;

He never leaves me lonely, whispers,

O so kind: “I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.

2.  All the world seemed to sing of a Savior and King,

When peace sweetly came to my heart;

Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,

Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

3.  This treasure I have in a temple of clay,

While here on His footstool I roam;

But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,

Over there to my heavenly home!
