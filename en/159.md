1.  Jesus only is our message,

Jesus all our theme shall be;

We will lift up Jesus ever,

Jesus only will we see.

Jesus only, Jesus ever,

Jesus all in all we sing,

Savior, Sanctifier, and Healer,

Glorious Lord and coming King.

2.  Jesus only is our Savior,

All our guilt He bore away,

He, our righteousness forever,

All our strength from day to day.

3.  Jesus is our Sanctifier,

Saving us from self and sin,

And with all His Spirit’s fullness,

Filling all our hearts within.

4.  Jesus only is our Healer,

All our sicknesses He bare,

And His risen life and fullness,

All His members still may share.

5.  Jesus only is our Power,

He the gift of Pentecost;

Jesus, breathe Thy pow’r upon us.

Fill us with the Holy Ghost.

6.  And for Jesus we are waiting,

List’ning for the Advent Call;

But ‘twill still be Jesus only,

Jesus ever, all in all.
