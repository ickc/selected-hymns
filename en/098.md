1.  Hark! the voice of love and mercy

Sounds aloud from Calvary;

See, it rends the rocks asunder,

Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:

“It is finished!” “It is finished!”

Hear the dying Savior cry.

2.  “It is finished!” Oh, what pleasure

Do these charming words afford!

Heavenly blessings without measure

Flow to us from Christ, the Lord:

“It is finished!” “It is finished!”

Saints, the dying words record.

3.  Finished all the types and shadows

Of the ceremonial law!

Finished all that God had promised;

Death and hell no more shall awe:

“It is finished!” “It is finished!”

Saints, from hence your comfort draw.

4.  Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,

Join to sing the pleasing theme;

All on earth and all in heaven

Join to praise Emmanuel’s name:

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Glory to the bleeding Lamb!
