# 136 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;

Rolling as a mighty ocean,

In its fullness over me,

Underneath me, all around me,

Is the current of Thy love;

Leading onward, leading homeward,

To my glorious rest above.

2.  Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Spread His praise form shore to shore;

How He loveth, ever loveth,

Changeth never, never more;

How He watcheth o’er His loved ones,

Died to call them all His own;

How for them He intercedeth,

Watcheth o’er them from the throne.

3.  Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

Love of every love the best;

’Tis an ocean vast of blessing,

’Tis a haven sweet of rest.

Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,

‘Tis a heav’n of heav’ns to me;

And it lifts me up to glory,

For it lifts me up to Thee.
