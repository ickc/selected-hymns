# 077 8.8.8.8.

1.  When I survey the wondrous cross

On which the Prince of glory died

My richest gain I count but loss,

And pour contempt on all my pride.

2.  Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,

Save in the cross of Christ my God;

All the vain things that charm me most,

I sacrifice them to His blood.

3.  See from His head, His hands, His feet,

Sorrow and love flow mingled down;

Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,

Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

4.  His dying crimson like a robe,

Spreads o’er His body on the tree;

Then am I dead to all the globe,

And all the globe is dead to me.

5.  Were the whole realm of nature mine,

That were an offering far too small:

Love so amazing, so divine,

Demands my heart, my life, my all!
