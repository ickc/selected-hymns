# 275 7.7.7.7.

1.  Not where we elect to go,

But where Jesus leads the way,

There the living waters flow,

There our darkness turns to day.

2.  Not our self-appointed task

Will the Lord’s approval win,

But the work we did not ask,

Finished humbly, just for Him.

3.  Not the prayer we long to plead

When we bend before the Throne,

But the touching deeper need

Of the Spirit’s wordless groan.

4.  Not the gift we proudly lay

On His altar will He heed,

If our hearts have said Him, “Nay,”

When He whispered, “I have need.”

5.  Thus we die, and dying live

In the heavenlies with the Lord;

Thus we serve, and pray, and give,

Christ Himself our great Reward.
