1.  Sweet feast of love divine!

‘Tis grace that makes us free

To feed upon this bread and wine,

In mem’ry, Lord, of Thee.

2.  Here every welcome guest

Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn

The secrets of Thy Father’s breast,

And all Thy grace discern.

3.  Here conscience ends its strife,

And faith delights to prove

The sweetness of the Bread of Life,

The fullness of Thy love.

4.  That blood that flowed for sin

In symbol here we see,

And feel the blessed pledge within

That we are loved of Thee.

5.  O if this glimpse of love

Is so divinely sweet,

What will it be, O Lord, above,

Thy gladdening smile to meet!

6.  To see Thee face to face,

Thy perfect likeness wear,

And all Thy ways of wondrous grace

Through endless years declare.
