# 171 12.12.12.6. with chorus

1.  Oh, spread the tidings ‘round,

wherever man is found,

Wherever human hearts

and human woes abound;

Let ev’ry Christian tongue

proclaim the joyful sound:

The Comforter has come!

The Comforter has come,

The Comforter has come!

The Holy Ghost from heav’n,

The Lord’s dear promise giv’n;

Oh, spread the tidings ‘round,

Wherever man is found—

The Comforter has come!

2.  The long, long night is past,

the morning breaks at last;

And hushed the dreadful

wail and fury of the blast,

As o’er the golden hills

the day advances fast!

The Comforter has come!

3.  Lo, the great King of kings,

with healing in His wings,

To every captive soul

a full deliv’rance brings;

And through the vacant cells

the song of triumph rings:

The Comforter has come!

4.  O boundless love divine!

how shall this tongue of mine

To wond’ring mortals tell

the matchless grace divine—

That I, a child of hell,

should in His image shine!

The Comforter has come!
