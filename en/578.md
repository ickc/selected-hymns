1.  I know not what awaits me,

God kindly veils my eyes,

And o’er each step of my onward way

He makes new scenes to rise;

And every joy He sends me comes

A sweet and glad surprise.

Where He may lead I’ll follow,

My trust in Him repose;

And every hour in perfect peace,

I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;

And every hour in perfect peace,

I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”

2.  One step I see before me,

’Tis all I need to see,

The light of heaven more brightly shines

When earth’s illusions flee;

And sweetly through the silence comes,

His loving, “Trust in Me!”

3.  Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,

’Tis blessed not to know;

He holds me with His own right hand,

And will not let me go,

And lulls my troubled soul to rest

In Him who loves me so.

4.  So on I go not knowing;

I would not if I might;

I’d rather walk in the dark with God

Than go alone in the light;

I’d rather walk by faith with Him

Than go alone by sight.
