# 181 16.11.16.11. with chorus

1.  O let the Son of God enfold you

with His Spirit and His love,

Let Him fill your life and satisfy your soul.

O let Him have the things that hold you

and His Spirit, like a dove

Will descend upon your life and make you whole.

Jesus, O Jesus,

Come and fill your lambs.

Jesus, O Jesus,

Come and fill your lambs.

2.  O come and sing this song with gladness

as your hearts are filled with joy,

Lift your hands in sweet surrender to His name.

O give Him all your tears and sadness,

give Him all your years of pain

And you’ll enter into life in Jesus’ name.

(Repeat Chorus)
