1.  Thou whose name is called Jesus,

Risen Lord of life and pow’r,

Oh, it is so sweet to trust Thee,

Every day and every hour;

Of Thy wondrous grace I sing,

Savior, Counsellor, and King.

2.  Thou canst keep my feet from falling,

Even my poor wayward feet;

Thou who dost present me faultless

In Thee—Righteousness complete;

Jesus, Lord, in knowing Thee,

Oh, what strength and victory.

3.  All the sin in me, my Savior,

Thou canst conquer and subdue;

With Thy sanctifying power

Permeate my spirit through;

Let Thy government increase,

Risen, crowned, Prince of Peace.

4.  Thou canst keep me upward looking,

Ever upward in Thy face;

Thou canst make me stand, upholden

By the greatness of Thy grace;

Every promise of Thy word

Now I claim from Thee, dear Lord.

5.  Oh! what joy to trust Thee, Jesus,

Mighty Victor o’er the grave,

And to learn amid earth’s shadows

Thine unceasing power to save!

Only those who prove Thee know

What the grace Thou dost bestow.

6.  Make my life a bright outshining

Of Thy life, that all may see

Thine own resurrection power

Mightily put forth in me;

Ever let my heart become

Yet more consciously Thy home.
