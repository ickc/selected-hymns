# 530 7.7.7.3.D. with chorus

1.  Jesus is reality,

He is life for you and me

And our ev’rything would be.

Call Him Lord.

What the prophets waited for

And the righteous had in store

You may have forevermore

Call Him Lord.

Call Him Lord. Call Him Lord.

In the spirit, by the Spirit,

Call Him Lord.

He has called you for His own,

In your heart His Word is sown,

You can make your heart His throne.

Call Him Lord.

2.  All the world would you forsake,

All sin’s bondage fully break,

Fully of His life partake?

Eat His Word.

God desires to be your life,

Set you free from every strife.

Come and taste the Tree of Life.

Eat His Word.

Eat His Word, Eat His Word,

Get it early, get it hourly,

Eat His Word.

What a treasure in your hand!

What an all-inclusive Land!

For your up-to-date demand,

Eat His Word.

3.  With our old life now we’re done,

For the Day is coming on

And the night is almost gone:

Overcome!

Praise the Lord we have an ear,

In the church life we can hear

Jesus calling very clear:

Overcome!

Overcome! Overcome!

By obeying what He’s saying,

Overcome!

All our oldness cast away

Through the Body-life today.

He will soon be here to stay:

Overcome!
