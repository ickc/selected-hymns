# 320 9.9.9.4. with chorus

1.  Years I spent in vanity and pride,

Caring not my Lord was crucified,

Knowing not it was for me he died

On Calvary.

Mercy there was great, and grace was free;

Pardon there was multiplied to me;

There my burdened soul found liberty,

At Calvary.

2.  By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;

Then I trembled at the law I’d spumed,

Till my guilty soul imploring turned

To Calvary.

3.  Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus everything,

Now I gladly own Him as my King,

Now my raptured soul can only sing

Of Calvary.

4.  Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!

Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!

Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span

At Calvary !
