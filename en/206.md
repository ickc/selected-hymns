1.  Christian, seek not yet repose,

Hear thy gracious Savior say;

Thou art in the midst of foes:

Watch and pray.

2.  Principalities and powers,

Mustering their unseen array,

Wait for thy unguarded hours:

Watch and pray.

3.  Gird thy heavenly armor on,

Wear it ever night and day;

Ambushed lies the evil one:

Watch and pray.

4.  Hear the victors who o’ercame,

Still they mark each warrior’s way;

All with one sweet voice exclaim,

Watch and pray.

5.  Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,

Him thou lovest to obey;

Hide within thy heart His word:

Watch and pray.

6.  Watch, as if on that alone

Hung the issue of the day;

Pray, that help may be sent down:

Watch and pray.
