1.  My old person has been nullified;

With my Lord upon the cross he died;

Now in nothing shall he be applied;

He’s dead to me.

My new Person in my spirit dwells;

Springing in me as a bubbling well;

Flowing out until each part He fills With abundant life.

Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives;

And my heart to Him I’d daily give;

That my inner man could have a home

And a place to settle down, yes,

A place to call His own, and—

There be my complete reality,

There expressing all He is to me,

Living in my heart abundantly

As my Person real.

2.  By this Person being formed in me,

I’ll a member of His Body be,

No more acting individually,

But with the saints.

More and more our Person He must be;

That our natural personality

Be eliminated thoroughly

Till Christ is all.

Only Christ, our Person, must remain;

From our aims, our goals we must refrain,

Till the church be only Christ Himself

Built up as the one new man,

Thus fulfilling God’s great plan of—

Mingling fully with the human race

To obtain a proper dwelling place,

‘Stablishing His kingdom’s rule and grace;

Over all the earth.

Not Himself just individually,

But the church together corporately,

Taking Christ as all in all, to be

The full-grown, perfect man.
