# 137 13.13.13.13. with chorus

1.  I stand all amazed at the

love Jesus offers me,

Confused at the grace that so

fully He proffers me;

I tremble to know that for

me He was crucified,

That for me, a sinner, He

suffered, He bled and died.

O it is wonderful that

He should care for me

Enough to die for me!

O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

2.  I marvel that He would descend

from His throne divine

To rescue a soul so rebellious

and proud as mine;

That He should extend His great

love unto such as I,

Sufficient to own, to redeem,

and to justify.

3.  I think of His side, pierced and

bleeding to pay the debt,

Such mercy, such love and

devotion can I forget?

No, no! I will praise and adore

at the mercy seat,

Until at the glorified throne

I kneel at His feet.
