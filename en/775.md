# 775 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Lord Jesus Christ, our heart feels sweet

Whene'er we think on Thee,

And long that to Thy presence dear

We soon might raptured be!

Lord, like the pretty henna-flower,

In vineyards blossoming Thou art;

Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,

Admires and loves our heart!

2.  There is no music adequate

Thy grace in full to praise,

Nor there a heart which could enjoy

Thy love in every phase.

3.  Yet, what delights our heart the most

Is not Thy love, Thy grace;

But it is Thine own loving Self

That satisfies always.

4.  Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair,

And sweeter than the sweet;

Beside Thee, none in heaven or earth

Our heart's desire could meet.
