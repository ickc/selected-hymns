1.  I love my Lord, but with no love of mine,

For I have none to give;

I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine,

For by Thy love I live.

I am as nothing, and rejoice to be

Emptied, and lost, and swallow’d up in Thee.

2.  Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need,

And there is none beside;

From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed,

In Thee the bless’d abide.

Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace,

Our source, our center, and our dwelling-place.
