# 225 6.6.8.6.

1.  Let party names no more

The Christian world o’erspread;

Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,

Are one in Christ, their Head.

2.  Among the saints on earth

Let mutual love be found;

Heirs of the same inheritance,

With mutual blessings crowned.

3.  Let envy, child of hell!

Be banished far away:

Those in sweet fellowship should dwell,

Who the same Lord obey.

4.  Thus will the Church below

God’s purpose ever prove;

Where streams of endless pleasure flow,

And every heart is love.
