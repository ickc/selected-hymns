# 327 8.8.8.8.D.

1.  Since Christ my soul from sin set free,

This world has been a heav’n to me;

And mid earth’s sorrows and its woe,

’Tis heav’n my Jesus here to know.

Oh, hallelujah, yes, ’tis heav’n,

’Tis heav’n to know my sins forgiv’n!

On land or sea, what matters where?

Where Jesus is, ’tis heaven there.

2.  The earth was once a bitter place

Till Jesus showed His smiling face;

Now heaven’s begun within my soul,

‘Twill last while endless ages roll.

3.  What matters where on earth we dwell?

On mountaintop or in the dell,

In cottage or a mansion fair,

Where Jesus is, ’tis heaven there.
