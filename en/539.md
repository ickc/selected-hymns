# 539 12.8.12.8. with chorus

1.  From my spirit within flows a fountain of life—

The Triune God flowing in me;\
God the Father’s the source, Christ the Son is the course,\
And the Spirit imparts life to me.

Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,

And my soul-life at last I lay down;

O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;

At Your coming may life be my crown.

2.  In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;

He leads me by waters of rest;

No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;

In the flow I am perfectly blessed.

3.  Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,

To live in His presence divine;

Hallelujah, I’ve heard an encouraging word:

“Abide—you’re a branch in the vine.”
