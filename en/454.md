1.  Lord, I was blind; I could not see

In Thy marred visage any grace,

But now the beauty of Thy face

In radiant vision dawns on me.

2.  Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear

The thrilling music of Thy voice;

But now I hear Thee and rejoice,

And all Thine uttered words are dear!

3.  Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak

The grace and glory of Thy name;

But now, as touched with living flame,

My lips Thine eager praises wake.

4.  Lord, I was dead; I could not stir

My lifeless soul to come to Thee;

But now, since Thou hast quickened me,

I rise from sinâ€™s dark sepulcher.

5.  For Thou hast made the blind to see,

The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,

The dead to live; and, lo, I break

The chains of my captivity.
