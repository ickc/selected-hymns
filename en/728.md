# 728 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling,

Millions of souls forever may be lost;

Who, who will go, salvation’s story telling,

Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?

“All pow’r is given unto me,

All pow’r is given unto me,

Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,

And lo, I am with you alway.”

2.  See o’er the world, wide open doors inviting:

Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!

Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,

Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.

3.  “Why will ye die?” the voice of God is calling,

“Why will ye die?” re-echo in His name:

Jesus hath died to save from death appalling,

Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.
