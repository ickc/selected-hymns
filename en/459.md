# 459 8.6.8.6.

1.  Jesus, the very thought of Thee

With sweetness fills my breast;

But sweeter far Thy face to see,

And in Thy presence rest.

2.  Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,

Nor can the memory find

A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,

O Savior of mankind!

3.  O Hope of every contrite heart,

O Joy of all the meek,

To those who fall, how kind Thou art!

How good to those who seek!

4.  But what to those who find? Ah, this

Nor tongue nor pen can show;

The love of Jesus, what it is

None but His loved ones know.

5.  O Jesus! light of all below!

Thou fount of life and fire!

Surpassing all the joys we know,

And all we can desire.

6.  No other source have we but Thee,

Soul-thirst to satisfy.

Exhaustless spring! the waters free!

All other streams are dry.

7.  Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,

As Thou our Prize wilt be;

Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,

And through eternity.
