1.  Strong are the walls around me,

That hold me all the day;

But they who thus have bound me,

Cannot keep God away:

My very dungeon walls are dear,

Because the God I love is here,

2.  They know, who thus oppress me,

’Tis hard to be alone;\
But know not One can bless me,\
Who comes through bars and stone;\
He makes my dungeon’s darkness bright,\
And fills my bosom with delight.

3.  Thy love, O God, restores me

From sighs and tears to praise;

And deep my soul adores Thee,

Nor thinks of time or place:

I ask no more, in good or ill,

But union with Thy holy will.

4.  ’Tis that which makes my treasure,

’Tis that which brings my gain;

Converting woe to pleasure,

And reaping joy from pain.

Oh, ’tis enough, whate’er befall,

To know that God is All in all.
