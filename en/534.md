# 534 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  My God, my Portion, and my Love,

My everlasting All,

I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above,

Or on this earthly ball, Or on this earthly ball.

2.  What empty things are all the skies,

And this inferior clod!

There’s nothing here deserves my joys,

There’s nothing like my God, there’s nothing like my God.

3.  To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,

And health, and safe abode;

Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,

But they are not my God, But they are not my God.

4.  How vain a toy is glittering wealth,

If once compared to’ Thee!

Or what’s my safety, or my health,

Or all my friends to me, Or all my friends to me.

5.  Were I possessor of the earth,

And called the stars my own,

Without Thy graces and Thyself,

I were a wretch undone, I were a wretch undone.

6.  Let others stretch their arms like seas,

And grasp in all the shore;

Grant me the visits of Thy grace,

And I desire no more, And I desire no more.
