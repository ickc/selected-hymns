1.  O God and Father, we our praises bring,

For who more worthy of our praise could be

Than Thou, who seekest worshipers who sing

In spirit and in truth^["truth" denote Christ] adoringly!

2.  All worlds Thou hast created by the Son,

All things are held by His unmeasured power;

Yet we approach Thee in that glorious One:

What cause for worship in this holy hour!

3. ' Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere,

In the assembly singing praise to Thee;

What joy to Him that we should thus be near

As suited and in perfect liberty!

4.  Here we unite, our song of joy is one!

And Thou, O God, art fully satisfied.

Amidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son,

Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide.
