1.  All things are possible to him

That can in Jesus’ name-believe;

Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,

Thy truth I lovingly receive.

I can, I do believe in Thee;

All things are possible to me.

2.  ’Twas most impossible of all

That here sin’s reign in me should cease;

Yet shall it be, I know it shall;

Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.

If nothing is too hard for Thee,

All things are possible to me.

3.  Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,

The Word of God shall never fail;

The Lord can break sin’s iron sway;

’Tis certain, though impossible.

The thing impossible shall be,

All things are possible to me.

4.  All things are possible to God;

To Christ, the power of God in man;

To me when I am all renewed,

In Christ am fully formed again,

And from the reign of sin set free,

All things are possible to me.

5.  All things are possible to God;

To Christ, the power of God in me;

Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,

Let me no longer live, but Thee;

Give me this hour in Thee to prove

The sweet omnipotence of love.
