1.  Through Thy precious body broken—

Inside the veil;

Oh! what words to sinners spoken—

Inside the veil.

Precious as the blood that bought us;

Perfect, as the love that sought us;

Holy, as the Lamb that brought us—

Inside the veil.

2.  When we see Thy love unshaken—

Outside the camp.

Scorned by man, by God forsaken—

Outside the camp.

Thy loved cross alone can charm us;

Shame need now no more alarm us;

Glad we follow, nought can harm us—

Outside the camp.

3.  Lamb of God, through Thee we enter—

Inside the veil.

Cleansed by Thee, we boldly venture—

Inside the veil.

Not a stain; a new creation:

Ours is such a full salvation;

Low we bow in adoration—

Inside the veil.

4.  Unto Thee, the homeless stranger—

Outside the camp,

Forth we hasten, fear no danger—

Outside the camp.

Thy reproach, far richer treasure

Than all Egypt’s boasted pleasure;

Drawn by love that knows no measure—

Outside the camp.

5.  Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered—

Inside the veil.

All with Thee—no more be scattered—

Inside the veil.

Nought from Thee, our hearts shall sever;

We shall see Thee; grieve Thee never;

“Praise the Lamb!” shall sound forever—

Inside the veil.
