# 257 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present

At Thy table freshly spread,

Seated at Thy priceless banquet

With Thy banner overhead.

Precious moments at Thy table,

From all fear and doubt set free;

Here to rest, so sweetly able,

Occupied alone with Thee.

2.  Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,

Gladly by Thy Spirit led;

Calmly in the blest remembrance

Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.

Lord, we take each simple token

In fond memory of Thee,

Muse upon Thy body broken

And Thy blood shed on the tree.

3.  Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,

In these chosen emblems here;

In the bread and wine of blessing—

Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!

Lord, behold us met together,

One in Thee, our risen Head,

Thus we take the cup of blessing,

Thus we share the broken bread.

4.  Lord, we know how true Thy promise

To be with us where we meet,

When in Thy loved name we gather

To enjoy communion sweet;

Dearer still that looked-for promise

To each waiting, yearning heart,

That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,

Yes, “forever” where Thou art.
