1.  Does Jesus care when my heart is pained

Too deeply for mirth or song,

As the burdens press, And the cares distress,

And the way grows weary and long?

O yes, He cares, I know He cares,

His heart is touched with my grief;

When the days are weary,

The long night dreary,

I know my Savior cares.

2.  Does Jesus care when my way is dark

With a nameless dread and fear?

As the daylight fades Into deep night shades,

Does He care enough to be near?

3.  Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed

To resist some temptation strong;

When for my deep grief There is no relief,

Though my tears flow all the night long?

4.  Does Jesus care when I’ve said “goodbye”

To the dearest on earth to me,

And my sad heart aches Till it nearly breaks,

Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
