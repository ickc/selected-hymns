# 017 8. 6. 8. 6.

1.  My God, how wonderful Thou art,

Thy majesty how bright,

How beautiful Thy mercy seat,

In depths of burning light.

2.  How dread are Thine eternal years,

O everlasting Lord,

By prostrate spirits day and night

Incessantly adored!

3.  How wonderful, how beautiful,

The sight of Thee must be,

Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,

And awful purity!

4.  Oh, how I fear Thee, living God,

With deepest, tenderest fears,

And worship Thee with trembling hope

And penitential tears!

5.  Yet I may love Thee, too, O Lord,

Almighty as Thou art,

For Thou hast stooped to ask of me

The love of my poor heart.

6.  No earthly father loves like Thee;

No mother, e’er so mild

Bears and forbears as Thou hast done

With me, Thy sinful child.

7.  Father of Jesus, love’s reward,

What rapture will it be

Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,

And gaze, and gaze on Thee.
