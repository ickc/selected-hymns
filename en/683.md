1.  Precious, precious blood of Jesus,

Shed on Calvary;

Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,

Shed for thee.

Precious, precious blood of Jesus

Ever flowing free;

Oh, believe it; Oh, receive it,

’Tis for thee.

2.  Precious, precious blood of Jesus,

Let it make thee whole;

Let it flow in mighty cleansing,

O’er thy soul.

3.  Though thy sins are red like crimson,

Deep in scarlet glow,

Jesus’ precious blood shall wash thee,

White as snow.

4.  Precious blood that hath redeemed us!

All the price is paid;

Perfect pardon now is offered,

Peace is made.

5.  Now the holiest with boldness

We may enter in;

For the open fountain cleanseth

From all sin.

6.  Precious blood, by this we conquer

In the fiercest fight,

Sin and Satan overcoming

By its might.

7.  Precious blood whose full redemption

Makes us nigh to God;

Precious blood, our way of glory,

Praise and laud.
