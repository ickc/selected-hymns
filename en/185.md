# 185 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,

Wash all my sins away,

That with Thy Holy Spirit

Thou may anoint, I pary.

My service, I confess, Lord,

Is falilure-full and weak;

The filling of Thy Spirit

To live for Thee I seek.

Oh, from myself deliver,

From all its misery;

I’d henceforth be forever

Completely filled with Thee.

2.  Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,

It yearns and pants for Thee;

The filling of Thy Spirit

Is now my fervent plea.

Within the smitten Rock, Lord,

I would entirely hide;

Pour thru Thy living water,

Till I am satisfied.

3.  How cold my heart has been, Lord,

How slow obeying Thee;

So fill me with Thy Spirit,

I’ll ne’er rebellious be.

I lie upon Thy altar

And dare not move away;

Oh, may Thy flame descending

Consume my all, I pray.

4.  Oh, may Thy Cross within me

Deepen its work and burn,

In me enlarge Thy measure.

And me to ashes turn.

Oh, may Thy Spirit fill me

Each day more than before,

And may Thy living water

On me and thru me pour.
