# 156 8.6.8.6.

1.  Come, let us join our cheerful songs,

And thus approach the throne;

Had we ten thousand thousand tongues,

Our theme of joy’s but one:

2.  “Worthy the Lamb that’s gone on high,

To be exalted thus!”

“Worthy the Lamb that died!” we cry,

“For He was slain for us.”

3.  Jesus is worthy to receive

Honor and pow’r divine;

And blessings more than we can give

Be, Lord, forever Thine.

4.  Soon shall the saints, exalted high,

A glorious anthem raise,

And all that dwell beneath the sky

Speak forth Thine endless praise.

5.  Redeemed creation join in one,

T’adore the sacred name

Of Him that sits upon the throne,

And to exalt the Lamb.
