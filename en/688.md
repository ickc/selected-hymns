# 688 9.8.9.8. with chorus

1.  Under the burdens of guilt and care,

Many a spirit is grieving,

Who in the joy of the Lord might share,

Life everlasting receiving.

Life! life! eternal life!

Jesus alone is the Giver:

Life! life! abundant life!

Glory to Jesus forever!

2.  Burdened one, why will you longer bear

Sorrows from which He releases?

Open your heart, and rejoicing, share

Life more abundant in Jesus.

3.  Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,

Flooding the vale with a river;

So, from the hill of the Cross, there flows

Life more abundant forever.

4.  Oh, for the flood on the thirsty land!

Oh, for a mighty revival!

Oh, for a sanctified, fearless band,

Ready to hail its arrival!
