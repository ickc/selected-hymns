# 111 8.6.8.6.D. Psalm 8

1.  O Lord, our Lord, how excellent

Thy name in all the earth!

Let every people, tribe, and tongue

Proclaim its boundless worth.

Out of the mouth of little ones

Thou hast established praise,

That Thou may still Thine enemy

And swiftly end his days.

2.  When we the universe behold,

The work of Thy great hand—

The sun, the moon, and all the stars

By lofty wisdom planned;

O what is man that Thou should’st care

That Thou should’st mindful be?

The son of man Thou visitest

In Thine economy.

3.  O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man,

The One who joined our race,

Who put upon Himself the flesh

And took a lower place.

But now with glory Thou art crowned,

With sovereignty complete.

Now through Thy Body Thou dost rule

With all beneath Thy feet.

4.  Thine incarnation, rising too,

And Thy transcendency,

Thy Lordship, Headship, kingdom full,

And Body here we see.

By all these steps of work divine

Thou hast established praise.

With overflowing hearts to Thee

Our joyful voice we raise.

5.  Oh, soon that blessed day shall come—

All tongues these words shall peal!

But in Thy tabernacles now

We have a foretaste real.

O Lord, our Lord, how excellent

Thy name in all the earth!

Let every people, tribe, and tongue

Proclaim its boundless worth.
