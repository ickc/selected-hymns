1.  I know that my Redeemer lives

And ever prays for me;

A token of His love He gives,

A pledge of liberty.

2.  I know that my Redeemer lives,

A quick’ning Spirit He;

I know eternal life He gives—

Amazing grace—to me.

3.  I find Him lifting up my head;

He brings salvation near;

His presence makes me free indeed,

And He will soon appear.

4.  He wills that I should holy be:

What can withstand His will?

The counsel of His grace in me

He surely shall fulfill.

5.  Jesus, I hang upon Thy word:

I steadfastly believe

Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord,

And to Thyself receive.
