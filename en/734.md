# 734 12.5.12.5. with chorus

1.  The Lord is the portion of my inheritance,

And He is my cup.

The Lord is the portion of my inheritance,

And He is my cup.

Thou wilt show me the path of life;

Thy presence is fullness of joy.

At Thy right hand there are pleasures

Forevermore.

2.  For I have set my Lord forever before me:

He’s at my right hand.

For I have set my Lord forever before me:

He’s at my right hand.

3.  Therefore is my heart glad, my spirit rejoiceth,

My flesh rests in hope.

Therefore is my heart glad, my spirit rejoiceth,

My flesh rests in hope.

(Do not repeat chorus after the last verse.)
