1.  Come let us sing of a wonderful love,

Tender and true;

Out of the heart of the Father above,

Streaming to me and to you:

Wonderful love

Dwells in the heart of the Father above.

2.  Jesus, the Savior, this gospel to tell,

Joyfully came;

Came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell,

Sharing their sorrow and shame;

Seeking the lost,

Saving, redeeming at measureless cost.

3.  Jesus is seeking the wanderers yet;

Why do they roam?

Love only waits to forgive and forget;

Home! weary wanderers, home!

Wonderful love

Dwells in the heart of the Father above.

4.  Come to my heart, O Thou wonderful love,

Come and abide,

Lifting my life till it rises above

Envy and falsehood and pride;

Seeking to be

Lowly and humble, a learner of Thee.
