# 046 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  In the Name of Jesus

Ev’ry knee shall bow,

Ev’ry tongue confess Him

King of glory now;

‘Tis the Father’s pleasure

We should call Him Lord,

Who from the beginning

Was the Mighty Word.

2.  At His voice creation

Sprang at once to sight:

All the angel faces,

All the hosts of light,

Thrones and dominations,

Stars upon their way,

All the heav’nly orders,

In their great array.

3.  Humbled for a season,

To receive a Name

From the lips of sinners

Unto whom He came,

Faithfully He bore it

Spotless to the last,

Brought it back victorious,

When from death He passed.

4.  Bore it up triumphant,

With its human light,

Through all ranks of creatures,

To the central height;

To the throne of Godhead,

To the Father’s breast,

Filled it with the glory

Of that perfect rest.

5.  Name Him, brothers, name Him,

With love strong as death,

But with awe and wonder,

And with bated breath;

He is God the Savior,

He is Christ the Lord,

Ever to be worshiped,

Trusted, and adored.

6.  In your hearts enthrone Him;

There let Him subdue

All that is not holy,

All that is not true;

Crown Him as your Captain

In temptation’s hour;

Let His will enfold you

In its light and power.

7.  Brothers, this Lord Jesus

Shall return again,

With His Father’s glory,

With His angel train;

For all wreaths of empire

Meet upon His brow,

And our hearts confess Him

King of glory now.
