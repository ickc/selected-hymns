1.  Christ the Lord is ris’n indeed,

Hallelujah!

He has met His people’s need,

Hallelujah!

Raise your joys and triumphs high,

Hallelujah!

Sing, ye heav’ns and earth, reply,

Hallelujah!

2.  Lives again our glorious King,

Hallelujah!

Where, O Death, is now thy sting?

Hallelujah!

Dying once He all doth save,

Hallelujah!

Where thy victory, O grave?

Hallelujah!

3.  Love’s redeeming work is done,

Hallelujah!

Fought the fight, the battle won,

Hallelujah!

Death in vain forbade Him rise

Hallelujah!

Christ ascended o’er the skies,

Hallelujah!

4.  Soar we now where Christ hath led.

Hallelujah!

Following our exalted Head,

Hallelujah!

Made like Him, like Him we rise.

Hallelujah!

Free from all the earthly ties,

Hallelujah!
