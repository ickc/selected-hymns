# 377 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  O God, we seek Your pleasure,

A vision of the Son,

Of that real living Person,

Your dear beloved One!

For He is God embodied,

And He is God expressed;

The Triune God in fullness

In Him is manifest.

2.  Now we would leave our own thoughts,

The veils upon our mind,

Removing all the layers

Which long have kept us blind.

Our God is always shining,

The Bible’s full of light,

But we’ve been thickly covered

From radiancy so bright.

3.  Lord, bind the god of this age!

We turn our hearts to You.

None other do we worship;

With all beside we’re through.

We’ve only hearts for You, Lord;

Your grace has captured us.

Oh, fill our hearts with vision,

Inward, yet glorious.

4.  O Father, how we praise You—

We have Your precious Word!

So full of revelation

That we may see the Lord.

May we pray o’er the verses

And with the saints pursue,

Then get a revelation,

And all Your glory view.

5.  ’Tis by our full obedience,

Our heart turned to the Lord,

Our mind set on the spirit

And praying o’er His Word,

That God gives in His pleasure

A vision of His Son,

Revealing Him within us,

His dear beloved One.
