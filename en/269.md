# 269 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  How I praise Thee, precious Savior,

That Thy love laid hold of me;

Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,

That I might Thy channel be.

Channels only, blessed Master,

But with all Thy wondrous pow’r

Flowing through us, Thou canst use us

Ev’ry day and ev’ry hour.

2.  Just a channel, full of blessing,

To the thirsty hearts around;

To tell out Thy full salvation,

All Thy loving message sound.

3.  Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,

I A clean vessel in Thine hand;

With no strength but as Thou givest

Graciously with each command.

4.  Witnessing Thy grace to save me,

Setting free from self and sin;

Thou hast bought me to possess me,

In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

5.  Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit,

Hearts that full surrender know;

That the streams of living water

From our inner man may flow.
