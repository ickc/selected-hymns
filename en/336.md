# 336 8.8.8.8. D.

1.  Complete in Thee! no work of mine

May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine;

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,

And I am now cornplete in Thee.

Yea, justified! O blessed thought!

And sanctified! Salvation wrought!

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,

And glorified, I too, shall be!

2.  Complete in Thee—no more shall sin,

Thy grace hath conquered, reign within;

Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee,

And I shall stand complete in Thee.

3.  Complete in Thee—each want supplied,

And no good thing to me denied;

Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,

I ask no more, complete in Thee.

4.  Dear Savior! when before Thy bar

All tribes and tongues assembled are,

Among Thy chosen will I be,

At Thy right hand—complete in Thee.
