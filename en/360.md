# 360 9.7.9.7. with chorus

1.  As the deer panteth for the water,

So my soul longeth after Thee.

You alone are my heart’s desire,

And I long to worship Thee.

You alone are my strength, my shield;

To You alone may my spirit yield.

You alone are my heart’s desire

And I long to worship Thee.

2.  You’re my friend and You are my brother

Even though You are a King.

I love You more than any other,

So much more than anything.

3.  I want You more than gold or silver,

Only You can satisfy.

You alone are the real joy giver

And the apple of my eye.
