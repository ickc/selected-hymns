1.  Teach us to pray that we may cause

The enemy to flee,

That we his evil powâ€™r may bind,

His prisoners to free.

2.  Teach us to pray and firmly stand

Upon the battleground,

To fight and break the stronghold down,

The enemy confound.

3.  Teach us to pray and use Thy rod

In strong, prevailing prayer,

Beneath Thy blood to shake the earth

And powers of the air.

4.  By prayer and faith, O may we learn

To labor, Lord. with Thee,

To know the victory is ours

And Thine authority.
