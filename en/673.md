# 673 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Alas, and did my Savior bleed?

And did my Sovereign die?

Would He devote that sacred head

For such a worm as I?

At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,

And the burden of my heart rolled away,

It was there by faith I received my sight,

And now I am happy all the day!

2.  Was it for sins that I had done

He groaned upon the tree?

Amazing pity! grace unknown!

And love beyond degree!

3.  Well might the sun in darkness hide,

And shut His glories in,

When Christ, the mighty Maker, died

For man, His creature’s sin.

4.  Thus might I hide my blushing face

While His dear cross appears.

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,

And melt mine eyes to tears.

5.  But drops of grief can ne’er repay

The debt of love I owe;

Here, Lord, I give myself away,

’Tis all that I can do.
