# 073 8.6.8.6.

1.  O lord! When we the path retrace

Which Thou on earth hast trod,

To men Thy wondrous love and grace,

Thy faithfulness to God;

2.  Thy love, by man so sorely tried,

Proved stronger than the grave;

The very spear that pierced Thy side

Drew forth the blood to save;

3.  Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,

Thy works were ever good;

Although midst sorrows all Thy life,

Thou spak’st no murmuring word.

4.  Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,

‘Mid darkness only light,

Thou didst Thy Father’s name confess,

And in His will delight;

5.  Unmoved by Satan’s subtle wiles,

Or suffering, shame, and loss,

Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,

Led only to the cross.

6.  We wonder at Thy lowly mind,

And fain would like Thee be,

And all our rest and pleasure find

In learning, Lord, of Thee.
