1.  No more in earthen vessels

God’s treasure then shall be,

But in unclouded beauty

Thou, Lord, wilt shine thru me.

2.  Afar thru that gold vessel

God’s glory shineth bright;

There’ll be no need of sunshine,

For God will be the light.

3.  With Christ, the Stone most precious,

God’s city shall be fair;

And He shall shine as jasper

In cloudless glow there:

4.  Undimmed in that great vessel,

The glory of that light,

Illum’ning with its fulness

The earth in radiance bright.

5.  All in His new creation

God’s glow there shall see;

The vessel for that shining

The Lamb’s own Bride shall be:

6.  A golden vessel glorious,

That all who see adore

God in the Lamb in glory

Expressed forevermore.
