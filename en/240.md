# 240 8.8.8.6. with chorus

1.  From ev’rything to Christ we’ve turned;

To trust in Him by grace we’ve learned.

And since His glory we’ve discerned

We only care for Christ!

We only care for Christ!

We only care for Christ!

And since His glory we’ve discerned

We only care for Christ!

2.  Christ brings us to God’s house to dwell,

Where all day long His praises swell.

Oh hallelujah! None can tell

How lovely is God’s house!

How lovely is God’s house!

How lovely is God’s house!

O hallelujah! None can tell

How lovely is God’s house!

3.  The house enlarged the city is;

The joy of all the nations ’tis,

The place for God to rule is this

On Zion’s holy hill.

On Zion’s holy hill,

On Zion’s holy hill,

The place for God to rule is this

On Zion’s holy hill.

4.  From Zion Christ will take the earth

And reign and fill its souls with mirth.

All nations will proclaim His worth,

Break forth and sing for joy.

Break forth and sing for joy,

Break forth and sing for joy,

All nations will proclaim His worth,

Break forth and sing for joy.

5.  Christ—house—the city—earth, we see;

Thus God’s great plan fulfilled will be.

O brothers, let us utterly

Be one with Him for this.

Be one with Him for this,

Be one with Him for this,

O brothers, let us utterly

Be one with Him for this.
