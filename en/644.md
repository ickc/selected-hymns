# 644 12.12.12.8. with chorus

1.  It may be at morn when the day is awaking,

When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,

That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory,

To receive from the world His own.

O Lord Jesus, how long, how long

Ere we shout the glad song, Christ returneth! Hallelujah!

Hallelujah! Amen,

Hallelujah! Amen.

2.  It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,

It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight

Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,

When Jesus receives His own.

3.  While hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,

With glorified saints and the angels attending,

With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,

Will Jesus receive His own.

4.  O joy! O delight! should we go without dying,

No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying,

Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,

When Jesus receives His own.
