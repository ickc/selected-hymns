# 276 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  There shall be showers of blessing:

This is the promise of love;

There shall be seasons refreshing,

Sent from the Savior above.

Showers of blessing,

Showers of blessing we need;

Mercy-drops round us are falling,

But for the showers we plead.

2.  There shall be showers of blessing

Precious reviving again;

Over the hills and the valleys,

Sound of abundance of rain.

3.  There shall be showers of blessing;

Send them upon us, O Lord!

Grant to us now a refreshing;

Come, and now honor Thy Word.

4.  There shall be showers of blessing:

O that today they might fall,

Now as to God weâ€™re confessing.

Now as on Jesus we call!

5.  There shall be showers of blessing.

If we but trust and obey;

There shall be seasons refreshing

If we let God have His way.
