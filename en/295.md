# 295 8.8.8.8. with chorus

1.  My hope is built on nothing less

Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness;

I dare not trust the sweetest frame,

But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand;

All other ground is sinking sand,

All other ground is sinking sand.

2.  When darkness veils His lovely face,

I rest on His unchanging grace;

In every high and stormy gale,

My anchor holds within the veil.

3.  His oath, His covenant, His blood,

Support me in the whelming flood;

When all around my soul gives way,

He then is all my hope and stay.

4.  When He shall come with trumpet sound,

Oh, may I then in Him be found;

Dressed in His Righteousness alone,

Faultless to stand before the throne.
