1.  Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,

Into Thy dear name I flee;

“Set aloft,” I praise and worship,

For Thy Name is victory!

2.  Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior!

In Thy Name is all I need;

Just to breathe the Name of Jesus,

Is to drink of Life indeed.

3.  Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,

Heav’n and earth its pow’r proclaim;

But forgiven sinners only,

Know the balm of Jesus’ Name.

4.  Jesus! Jesus! Name most precious,

Balm in pain or mighty sword;

In Thy Name, we live and conquer,

Blessed, glorious, coming Lord.
