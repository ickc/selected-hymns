1.  Keep up the song of faith,

However dark the night;

And as you praise, the Lord will work

To change your faith to sight.

2.  Keep up the song of faith,

And let your heart be strong,

For God delights when faith can praise

Though dark the night and long.

3.  Keep up the song of faith,

The foe will hear and flee;

Oh, let not Satan hush your song,

For praise is victory.

4.  Keep up the song of faith,

The dawn will break ere long,

And we shall go to meet the Lord,

And join the endless song.
