1.  Low in the grave He lay—

Jesus my Savior!

Waiting the coming day—

Jesus my Lord!

Up from the grave he arose,

With a mighty triumph o’er His foes;

He arose a Victor from the dark domain,

And He lives forever with His saints to reign.

He arose! He arose!

Hallelujah! Christ arose!

2.  Vainly they watch His bed—

Jesus, my Savior!

Vainly they seal the dead—

Jesus, my Lord!

3.  Death cannot keep his prey—

Jesus, my Savior!

He tore the bars away—

Jesus, my Lord!
