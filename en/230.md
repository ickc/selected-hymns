1.  Christ, from whom all blessings flow,

Perfecting the saints below,

Hear us, who Thy nature share,

Who Thy mystic body are.

2.  Join us, in one spirit join,

Let us still receive of Thine;

Still for more on Thee we call,

Thou who fillest all in all.

3.  Move, and actuate, and guide:

Divers gifts to each divide;

Placed according to Thy will,

Let us all our work fulfil.

4.  Sweetly may we all agree,

Touched with loving sympathy;

Kindly for each other care,

Every member feel its share.

5.  Love, like death, hath all destroyed,

Rendered all distinctions void;

Names, and sects, and parties fall:

Thou, O Christ, art all in all.
