1.  Our hearts are full of Christ and long

Their glorious matter to declare!

Of Him we make our loftier song,

We cannot from His praise forbear:

Our ready tongues make haste to sing

The glories of the heavâ€™nly King.

2.  Fairer than all the earthborn race,

Perfect in comeliness Thou art;

Replenished are Thy lips with grace,

And full of love Thy tender heart.

God ever-blest! we bow the knee,

And own all fullness dwells in Thee.
