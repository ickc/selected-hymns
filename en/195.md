1.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

It is a rich, good land to us,

Filled with the knowledge excellent

Of Christ, our portion glorious.

Oh, hallelujah for the Word!

No eye has seen, nor ear has heard,

Nor e’er has come up in our hearts

What wondrous grace the Word imparts.

2.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

It is the bountiful supply,

The living Spirit, causing us

Our Christ to live and magnify.

3.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

By it in us God operates

The willing and the working too,

And all our being saturates.

4.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

Our full salvation here is found

From murmurings, reasonings, rivalry,

That we in oneness may abound.

5.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

The living breathing of our God!

Blameless and guileless thru the Word,

We shine as lights for Christ our Lord.

6.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

It constitutes us all with Christ.

Then we express this glorious One

By holding forth the word of life.

7.  Oh, how we love the precious Word!

By it we’re gaining Christ each day;

‘Tis by it we in Him are found

And righteousness of faith display.
