# 356 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  There is a name I love to hear,

I love to sing its worth;

It sounds like music in mine ear,

The sweetest name on earth.

Oh, how I love Jesus,

Oh, how I love Jesus,

Oh, how I love Jesus,

Because He first loved me!

2.  It tells me of a Savior’s love,

Who died to set me free;

It tells me of His precious blood,

The sinner’s perfect plea.

3.  It tells me what my Father hath,

In store for every day,

And tho’ I tread a darksome path,

Yields sunshine all the way.

4.  It tells of One whose loving heart

Can feel my deepest woe,

Who in each sorrow bears a part,

That none can bear below.
