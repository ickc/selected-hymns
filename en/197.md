1.  Speak, Lord, in the stillness,

While I wait on Thee;

Hushâ€™d my heart ot listen,

In expectantancy.

2.  Speak, O blessed Master,

In this quiet hour;

Let me see Thy face, Lord,

Feel Thy touch of power.

3.  For the words Thou speakest,

They are life indeed;

Living bread from heaven,

Now my spirit feed!

4.  All to Thee is yielded,

I am not my own;

Blissful, glad surrender,

I am Thine alone.

5.  Speak, Thy servant heareth,

Be not silent, Lord;

Waits my soul upon Thee

For the quickening word.

6.  Fill me with the knowledge

Of Thy glorious will;

All Thine own good pleasure

In Thy child fulfill.

7.  Like a watered garden,

Full of fragrance rare,

Lingering in Thy presence,

Let my life appear.
