1.  Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;

What is there left for me to do?

Simply to cease from struggling and strife,

Simply to walk in newness of life.

Glory be to God!

2.  Risen with Christ, my glorious Head,

Holiness now the pathway I tread,

Beautiful thought, while walking therein:

He that is dead is freed from sin.

Glory be to God!

3.  Living with Christ, who dieth no more,

Following Christ, who goeth before;

I am from bondage utterly freed,

Reckoning self as dead indeed.

Glory be to God!

4.  Living for Christ, my members I yield,

Servants to God, for evermore sealed,

Not under law, I’m now under grace,

Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place.

Glory be to God!

5.  Growing in Christ; no more shall be named

Things of which now I’m truly ashamed,

Fruit unto holiness will I bear,

Life evermore, the end I shall share.

Glory be to God!
