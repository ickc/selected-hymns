# 733 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  “Must I go, and empty-handed,”

Thus my dear Redeemer meet?

Not one day of service give Him,

Lay no trophy at His feet?

“Must I go, and empty-handed?”

Must I meet my Savior so?

Not one soul with which to greet Him:

Must I empty-handed go?

2.  Not at death I shrink nor falter,

For my Savior saves me now;

But to meet Him empty-handed,

Thought of that now clouds my brow.

3.  O the years in sinning wasted;

Could I but recall them now,

I would give them to my Savior,

To His will I’d gladly bow.

4.  O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,

Up and work while yet ’tis day;

Ere the night of death o’ertake thee,

Strive for souls while still you may.
