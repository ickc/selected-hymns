# 231 8.6.8.6.

1.  How sweet, how heav’nly is the sight,

When those who love the Lord

In one another’s peace delight,

And so fulfill His Word;

2.  When each can feel his brother’s sigh,

And with him bear a part;

When sorrow flows from eye to eye,

And joy from heart to heart;

3.  When, free from envy, seem and pride,

Our wishes all above,

Each can his brother’s failings hide,

And show a brother’s love;

4.  When love, in one delightful stream,

Through every bosom flows;

When union sweet, and dear esteem,

In every action glows.

5.  Love is the golden chain that binds;

The saints Thy grace thus prove.

And he is glory’s heir that finds

His bosom glow with love.
