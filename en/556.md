# 556 8.6.8.6.

1.  If from the right course I depart,

Then ease my lot would be;

But I remember how my Lord

Did suffer agony.

2.  I’ll utterly forsake this world,

And sever all its ties.

My path may narrow more and more;

And all against me rise.

3.  Though men may scowl and laugh to scorn,

I only want His smile.

His “well done” only I’d secure

While here this little while.

4.  Not after greatness do I seek,

Nor glory here desire,

But humbly I would serve the Lord,

His praise that day acquire.

5.  I’m daily gazing at the light

Shed from His judgment seat,

That all my living and my work

The test of fire may meet.

6.  Let others seek for great success,

For glory, wealth, and name;

Let them procure their grandeur here,

Their followers and fame.

7.  In solitude and poverty,

Though prospering not in soul,

Yet faithfully I’ll follow Him

Until I reach the goal.

8.  I know that when on earth He dwelt

His lot was but the cross;

And that is why I only wish

With Him to suffer loss.

9.  Since all my glories lie ahead,

I must to patience cleave.

I will not go before my Lord

And glory here receive.

10.  That day my honors I will have;

The Lord will dry my tears.

So faithfully I’ll still press on

Until my Lord appears.
