1.  ’Tis my happiness below

Not to live without the cross;

But the Savior’s pow’r to know

Sanctifying every loss.

2.  Trials must and will befall;

But with humble faith to see

Love inscribed upon them all—

This is happiness to me.

3.  Did I meet no trials here,

No chastisement by the way,

Might I not with reason fear

I should prove a castaway?

4.  Trials make the promise sweet;

Trials give new life to prayer;

Bring me to my Savior’s feet,

Lay me low and keep me there.
