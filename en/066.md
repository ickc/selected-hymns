# 066 10.10.10.9. with chorus

1.  There have been names that I have loved to hear,

But never has there been a name so dear

To this heart of mine, as the name divine,

The precious name of Jesus.

Jesus is the sweetest name I know,

And He’s just the same as His lovely name.

And that’s the reason why I love Him so;

O Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

2.  There is no name in earth or heav’n above,

That we should give such honor and such love

As the blessed name; let us all acclaim

That wondrous, glorious name of Jesus.

3.  And someday I shall see Him face to face

To thank and praise Him for His wondrous grace

Which He gave to me when He made me free;

The blessed Son of God called Jesus.
