1.  Recall how David swore,

“I’ll not come into my house,

Nor go up to my bed,

Give slumber to my eyelids—

Until I find a place for Thee,

A place, O Lord, for Thee.”

Our mighty God desires a home

To dwell with all His own.

2.  How blinded we have been,

Shut in with what concerns us;

While God’s house lieth waste—

Lord, break through all and turn us!

We’ll go up to the mountain,

Bring wood and build the house;

We’ll never say, “Another day!”

It’s time to come and build.

3.  O Lord, against these days,

Inspire some for Your building,

Just as in David’s day—

A remnant who are willing

To come and work in Your house,

Oh, what a blessed charge!

Your heart’s desire, is our desire—

We give ourselves to build.

4.  Within those whom You’d call

Put such a restless caring

For building to give all—

These times are for preparing;

The gates of hell cannot prevail

Against the builded Church!

The hours are few, the builders too—

We rise, O Lord, to build!
