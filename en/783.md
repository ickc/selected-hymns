1.  Lord, when by baptism we confess

Our oneness in Thy death,

Oh, by Thy mercy and Thy grace,

May Thou revea! its worth.

2.  By baptism in Thy death we're one

And buried too with Thee:

Thus we're forever dead to sin

And from its bondage free.

3.  By baptism iin Thy death we're one

And buried too with Thee;

Thus to the world we bid farewell,

From Satan's slavery free.

4.  We're resurrected with Thee too,

From death's great pow'r set free;

Now fruit Of holiness we bear\~

In our new life with Thee.

5.  We're baptized unto Thy dear name,

No more our own are we;

Thy steps we'd follow, for Thee live,

And e'er be one with Thee.
