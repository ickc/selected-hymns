# 465 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Christ is now in resurrection,

From the old creation free.

See, He left behind His grave-clothes;

In the new creation, He.

Resurrection, Resurrection,

That is where we want to be;

Living in the new creation

Now and for eternity.

2.  All His being e’en His body,

Now are in divinity.

He with God is fully mingled,

And our prototype is He!

3.  We too need His resurrection

In our being to be wrought

That our spirit, soul, and body

Into God be fully brought.

4.  Lord, we seek an extra portion

Of the resurrection life.

This our goal—out-resurrection

From the old creation rife.

5.  Resurrected was our spirit

When we into Thee believed.

Now our soul needs resurrection

By the Spirit’s word received.

6.  How our mind, will, and emotion

Need His rescue every hour!

Lord, uplift from our old being

All our inward parts with power.

7.  Then the God of resurrection

To our body will give life,

And we’ll live in resurrection,

Every part conformed to Christ.
