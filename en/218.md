# 218 8.8.8.8.D.

1.  Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,

That calls me from a world of care,

And bids me at my Father’s throne

Make all my wants and wishes known:

In seasons of distress and grief

My soul has often found relief,

And oft escaped the tempter’s snare

By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

2.  Sweet hour of pray’r! sweet hour of pray’r,

The joy I feel, the bliss I share,

Of those whose anxious spirits bum

With strong desires for Thy return!

With such I hasten to the place

Where God, my Savior, shows His face,

And gladly take my station there,

And wait for thee, sweet hour of pray’r.

3.  Sweet hour of pray’r! sweet hour of pray’r,

Thy wings shall my petition bear

To Him whose truth and faithfulness

Engage the waiting soul to bless;

And since He bids me seek His face,

Believe His word, and trust His grace.

I’ll cast on Him my ev’ry care,

And wait for thee, sweet hour of pray’r.
