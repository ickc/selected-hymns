# 469 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Art thou hung’ring for the fulness

Of the blessing Christ doth give?

Longing now to \]earn the secret

Of the life He bids thee live?

In His word thine answer standeth,

“Christ who is our Life” it saith;

Open now thy heart, and trust Him,

There to dwell, henceforth, by faith.

2.  Christ, the Lord’s Anointed, reigning

O’er the life He died to win,

Daily shall reveal more fully

His great power, without, within.

What thou never could’st accomplish

Shall His Spirit work through thee,

While thy soul this witness beareth,

’Tis not I, but Christ in me.

3.  In Him dwelleth all God’s fulness,

In Him thou art made complete;

Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright,

Kneeling at thy Father’s feet.

He will never disappoint thee,

Praise Him that the gift is thine;

Then go forth to live each moment

On sufficiency divine.

4.  Lord, I come, and simply resting

On Thy faithful, changeless word,

I believe the blood doth cleanse me,

And that Christ is crowned Lord.

Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow

Of Thy life and love through me;

Reaching those who sit in darkness,

Winning priceless souls to Thee.
