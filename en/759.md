Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.

So turn your heart to the Lord all the day,

And the veil shall be taken away.

Now the Lord is that Spirit,

And where the Spirit of the Lord is,

There is libertyâ€”such liberty!

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.
