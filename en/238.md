# 238 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  The Bible is the Word of God,

Its message is but one—

Christ and the church, His holy Bride,

The two becoming one.

Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!

Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside

That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air

And ever in our Bridegroom’s love abide.

2.  The Father is the mighty God,

His purpose is but one—

To find a Bride for Christ the Lord

And give her to His Son.

3.  The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,

His heart desire’s but one—

To have a loving counterpart,

A Bride He’s wooed and won.

4.  The Spirit is but Christ Himself,

He is the Lord applied

To generate the men of earth,

Transform them as His Bride.

5.  The living Word is Jesus too,

God-breathed as life to us,

That we be wholly sanctified,

A Bride all-glorious.
