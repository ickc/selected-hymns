# 526 7.5.7.5.D.

1.  In God’s image we were made;

Made for Him to fill,

Thus Himself to duplicate, and

Duplicate He will!

“In God’s image,” yes, indeed—

Matching ev’ry trait.

All His inner life and being

He will duplicate!

2.  Adam’s life was like a cone

To contain the Tree;

Man was made to take in God—

What capacity!

God’s container, yes, indeed!

Thus He did design

All the human virtues to be

Filled with the divine.

3.  Lost, the image, through man’s fall;

Lost, the life to fill.

But—recovered!—Christ is all:

God will do it still.

Christ our Savior—God and Man—

Is God’s image tree:

Human virtues, life divine

Dwell in me and you.

4.  As we spend more time with Him,

He will spread in us;

Virtues filled with life within:

Image glorious!

We will match Him—yes, indeed;

Match His every trait!

All His inner life and being

He will duplicate!
