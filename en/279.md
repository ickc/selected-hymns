# 279 10.6.10.6. with chorus

1.  She only touch’d the hem of His garment

As to His side she stole,

Amid the crowd that gather’d around Him;

And straightway she was whole.

Oh, touch the hem of His garment,

And thou, too, shalt be free!

His healing pow’r this very hour

Shall give new life to thee!

2.  She came in fear and trembling before Him,

She knew her Lord had come,

She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,

The mighty deed was done.

3.  He turned with “Daughter, be of good comfort,

Thy faith hath made thee whole”;

And peace that passeth all understanding

With gladness filled her soul.
