# 353 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  Jesus Thine all victorious love

Shed in my soul abroad;

Then shall my heart no longer rove,

Rooted and fixâ€™d in God.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  Oh, that in me the sacred fire

Might now begin to glow;

Burn up the dross of base desire,

And make the mountains flow.

3.  Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall,

Do Thou my sins consume;

Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call;

Spirit of Burning, come!

4.  Refining fire, go through my heart,

Illuminate my soul;

Scatter Thy life through every part,

And sanctify the whole.

5.  My steadfast soul, from falling free,

Shall then no longer move,

While Christ is all the world to me,

And all my heart is love.
