# 436 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  I’ve turned my back upon the world

With all its idle pleasures,

And set my heart on better things,

On higher, holier treasures;

No more its glitter and its glare,

And vanity shall blind me;

I’ve crossed the separating line,

And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!

Far, far behind me!

I’ve crossed the separating line,

And left the world behind me.

2.  I’ve left the old sad life of sin,

Its follies all forsaken;

My standing place is now in Christ,

His holy vows I’ve taken;

Beneath the standard of the cross

The world henceforth shall find me;

I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,

And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!

Far, far behind me!

I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,

And left the world behind me.

3.  My soul shall ne’er return again

Back to its former station,

For here alone is perfect peace,

And rest from condemnation;

I’ve made exchange of masters now,

The vows of glory bind me,

And once for all I’ve left the world,

Yes, left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!

Far, far behind me!

And once for all I’ve left the world,

Yes, left the world behind me.

4.  My choice is made forevermore,

I want no other Savior;

I ask no purer happiness

Than His sweet love and favor;

My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,

No more the world shall blind me;

I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,

And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!

Far,’ far behind me!

I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,

And left the world behind me.
