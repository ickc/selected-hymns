# 601 11.11.11.11.

1.  O eyes that are weary and hearts that are sore,

Look off unto Jesus and sorrrow no more;

The light of His countenance shineth so bright,

That on earth as in heaven, there need be no night.

2.  “Looking off unto Jesus,” my spirit is blest;

In the world I have turmoil—in Him I have rest;

The sea of my life all about me may roar,

When I look unto Jesus I hear it no mom.

3.  “Looking off unto Jesus,” I go not astray;

My eyes are on Him, and He shows me the way;

The path may seem dark as He leads me along,

But following Jesus I cannot go wrong.

4.  “Looking off unto Jesus,” my heart cannot fear,

Its trembling is still when I see Jesus near;

I know that His power my safeguard will be,

For, “Why are you troubled?” He saith unto me.

5.  Soon, soon shall I know the full beauty and grace

Of Jesus my Lord when I stand face to face;

I shall know how His love went before me each day,

And wonder that ever my eyes turned away.
