# 660 11.11.11.11. with chorus

1.  He looked for a city and lived in a tent,

A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;

God’s promise his solace, so royal his birth,

No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.

City! O city fair!

God’s dwelling with man to eternity is there.

2.  He looked for a city, his God should prepare;

No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,

For had not God told him, that royal abode

Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.

3.  He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed

To be trudging the road, all earth’s glory denied,

The thought of that city changed sighing to song,

For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.

4.  He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share

And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare

Is ever our portion, since willing to be

Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.
