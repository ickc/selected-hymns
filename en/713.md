# 713 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  I love to tell the story,

Of unseen things above,

Of Jesus and His glory,

Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story,

Because I know ‘tis true;

It satisfies my longings

As nothing else can do.

I love to tell the story,

‘Twill be my theme in glory

To tell the old, old story

Of Jesus and His love.

2.  I love to tell the story;

More wonderful it seems

Than all the golden fancies

Of all my golden dreams,

I love to tell the story,

It did so much for me;

And that is just the reason

I tell it now to thee.

3.  I love to tell the story;

’Tis pleasant to repeat

What seems each time I tell it,

More wonderfully sweet.

I love to tell the story;

For some have never heard

The message of salvation

From God’s own holy Word.

4.  I love to tell the story;

For those who know it best

Seem hungering and thirsting

To hear it like the rest.

And when, in scenes of glory,

I sing the new, new song,

‘Twill be the old, old story,

That I have loved so long.
