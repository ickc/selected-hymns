# 233 8.6.8.6. with repeat (Repeat the last line of each stanza)

1.  All praise to our redeeming Lord,

Who joins us by His grace,

And bids us, each to each restored,

Together seek His face.

2.  He bids us build each other up;

And, gathered into one,

To our high callingâ€™s glorious hope,

We hand in hand go on.

3.  The gift which He on one bestows,

We all delight to prove;

The grace through every vessel flows,

In purest streams of love.

4.  We all partake the joy of one;

The common peace we feel;

A peace to worldly minds unknown,

A joy unspeakable.

5.  And if our fellowship below

In Christ yet be so sweet,

What height of rapture shall we know,

When round His throne we meet!
