# 451 8.8.8.8.

1.  Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery,

How on the Cross I died with Thee;

I need no other pow’r or way

That I may triumph day by day.

2.  That cross of Thine is also mine,

Into my life its light doth shine;

When I believe I’m dead with Thee,

The world has lost its pow’r o’er me.

3.  Since I am crucified with Thee,

From sin and self I am set free;

How can I still enjoy the world

Or seek its vanities unfurled?

4.  I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee

Upon the cross of Calvary.

Thy life and power then are mine,

Since Thou and I in oneness twine.

5.  Since Thou didst come to slay the foe,

His work and power to overthrow,

I too can overcome in Thee

And prove Thy mighty pow’r in me.

6.  Yet, for the vict’ry we rely

Upon the death which Thou didst die;

We tread the path which Thou hast trod

Until we reach the goal in God.

7.  My death with Thee I now believe

And all its meaning would receive.

Thy death more deeply show to me,

That from my flesh I may be free.

8.  I long to win as Thou hast won,

To reign with Thee when Thou dost come.

If we the cross will gladly bear,

Then in Thy glory we will share.
