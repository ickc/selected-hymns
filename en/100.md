# 100 10.10.10.10.

1.  The Lord is ris’n; and death’s dark judgment flood

Is passed, in Him who bought us with his blood.

The Lord is ris’n: we stand beyond the doom

Of all our sin, through Jesus’ empty tomb.

2.  The Lord is ris’n: with Him we also rose,

And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.

The Lord is ris’n: beyond the judgment land,

In Him, in resurrection-life we stand.

3.  The Lord is ris’n: and now redeemed to God,

We tread the desert which His feet have trod.

The Lord is ris’n: the sanctu’ry’s our place,

Where now we dwell before the Father’s face.

4.  The Lord is ris’n: the Lord is gone before.

We long to see Him, and to sin no more.

The Lord is ris’n: our triumph-shout shall be,

“Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!”
