1.  The law of the Lord is perfect

Converting the soul:

The testimony of the Lord is sure,

Making wise the simple.

More to be desired are they than gold.

Yea, than much fine gold:

Sweeter also than honey

And the honeycomb.

2.  The statutes of the Lord are right,

Rejoicing the heart:

The commandment of the Lord is pure,

Enlightening the eyes.

3.  The fear of the Lord is clean,

Enduring forever;

The judgments of the Lord are true

And righteous altogether.

4.  Let the words of my mouth,

And the meditation of my heart,

Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord,

My strength, and my redeemer.

Moreover by them is Thy servant warned

Is Thy servant warned:

And in keeping of them

There is great reward.
