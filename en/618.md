# 618 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  Onward Christian soldiers!

Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus

Going on before. Christ, the royal Master, Leads against the foe;

Forward into battle, See, His banners go!

Onward, Christian soldiers!

Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus, Going on before.

2.  At the name of Jesus Satan’s host doth flee;

On then, Christian soldiers, On to victory!

Hell’s foundations quiver At the shout of praise:

Brothers, lift your voices, Loud your anthems raise!

3.  Like a mighty army Moves the Church of God:

Brothers, we are treading Where the saints have trod;

We are not divided, All one Body we—

One in faith and Spirit, One eternally.

4.  Crowns and thrones may perish, Kingdoms rise and wane;

But the Church of Jesus Constant will remain.

Gates of hell can never’ Gainst the Church prevail;

We have Christ’s own promise, Which can never fail.

5.  Onward, then, ye people! Join our happy throng;

Blend with ours your voices In the triumph song.

Glory, laud and honor Unto Christ, the King;

This through countless ages Men and angels sing.
