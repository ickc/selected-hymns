# 155 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  Jesus, our Lord, with what joy we adore Thee,

Chanting our praise to Thyself on the throne!

Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,

Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone.

Lord, Thou art worthy: Lord, Thou art worthy;

Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,

Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

2.  Verily God, yet become truly human,

Lower than angels to die in our stead;

How has that long promised “Seed of the woman”

Trod on the serpent and bruised his head!

3.  How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken,

Led by Thy creatures and nailed to the cross,

Hated of men, and of God too forsaken,

Shunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss.

4.  How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory,

Battled death’s forces, rolled back every wave!

Can we refrain then from telling the story?

Lord, Thou art Victor o’er death and the grave.
