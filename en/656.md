# 656 12.12.12.12. with chorus

1.  Our faith to God-ward must in these days spread abroad

To show we’ve turned from idols to the living God.

We’ll mix His Word with faith by answering “Amen!”

And to Christ in the Word turn again and again.

Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,

The labor of our love increase abundantly,

His sanctifying work in us go on and on,

While in patience of hope we will watch till He come.

2.  The love for all the brothers, in our midst is found,

But in these days our love must increase and abound.

The Lord direct our hearts into the love of God

And prepare us in full for the day of the Lord.

3.  Our spirit, soul, and body wholly sanctified—

Our faithful Lord will do it to prepare His Bride,

While we amen His voice in matters great or small,

That we all may be ready to hear Jesus’ call.

4.  The Lord Himself shall come, and we shall be with Him—

Oh, what a glorious hope! Come quickly, Lord, Amen.

We’d ever watchful be to see Thee in the air

And as sons of the day for that meeting prepare.
