1.  Jesus, Redeemer and my one Inspirer,

Heat in my coldness, set my life aglow.

Break down my barriers; draw, yea, draw me nigher.

Thee would I know, whom it is life to know.

2.  Deepen me, rid me of the superficial;

From pale delusion set my spirit free;

All the entangled in me quick unravel;

Pluck forth each thread of insincerity.

3.  Thy vows are on me, oh to serve Thee truly—

Love perfectly, in purity obey—

Burn, burn, O Fire. O Wind, now winnow throughly;

O Sword, awake against the flesh and slay.
