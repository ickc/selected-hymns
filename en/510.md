# 510 8.8.8.8. with chorus

1.  The Lord’s our Rock, in Him we hide,

A shelter in the time of storm;

Secure whatever ill betide,

A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land!

A weary land, a weary land;

Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land!

A shelter in the time of storm.

2.  A shade by day, defense by night,

A shelter in the time of storm;

No fears alarm, no foes affright,

A shelter in the time of storm.

3.  The raging storms may round us beat,

A shelter in the time of storm;

We’ll never leave our safe retreat,

A shelter in the time of storm.

4.  O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,

A shelter in the time of storm;

Be Thou our helper ever near,

A shelter in the time of storm.
