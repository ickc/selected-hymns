# 323 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  I heard the voice of Jesus say,

“Come unto Me, and rest;

Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

Thy head upon My breast.”

I came to Jesus as I was,

Weary, and worn, and sad;

I found in Him a resting-place,

And He has made me glad.

2.  I heard the voice of Jesus say,

“Behold, I freely give

The living water: thirsty one,

Stoop down, and drink, and live.”

I came to Jesus, and I drank

Of that life-giving stream;

My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

And now I live in Him.

3.  I heard the voice of Jesus say,

“I am this dark world’s Light;

Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,

And all thy days be bright.”

I looked to Jesus, and I found

In Him my Star, my Sun;

And in that Light of life I’ll walk

Till trav’lling days are done.
