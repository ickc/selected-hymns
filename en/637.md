1.  And is it so! I shall be like Thy Son?

Is this the grace which He for me has won?

Father of gloryâ€”thought beyond all thought!

In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!

2.  Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?

Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see

Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,

Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.

3.  Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest

Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;

That love that gives not as the world, but shares

All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.

4.  Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete

In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet;

All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,

Object supreme of all, by all adored.
