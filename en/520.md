# 520 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  On Thee my heart is resting,

Ah, this is rest indeed:

What else, Almighty Savior,

Can a poor sinner need?

Thy light is all my wisdom,

Thy love is all my stay;

Thy coming back in glory,

Draws nearer every day.

On Thee my heart is resting,

Ah, this is rest indeed:

What else, Almighty Savior,

Can a poor sinner need?

2.  My guilt is great, but greater

The mercy Thou dost give;

Thyself, a spotless Off’ring,

Hast died that I should live.

With Thee, my soul unfettered

Has risen from the dust;

Thy blood is all my treasure,

Thy word is all my trust.

3.  Through me, Thou gentle Master,

Thy purposes fulfil;

I yield myself forever

To Thy most holy will.

What though I be but weakness?

My strength is not in me;

The poorest of Thy people

Has all things, having Thee.

4.  When clouds are darkest round me,

Thou, Lord, art then most near,

My drooping faith to quicken,

My weary soul to cheer.

Safe nestling in Thy bosom,

I gaze upon Thy face;

In vain my foes would drive me

From Thee, my hiding-place.

5.  ’Tis Thou hast made me happy,

’Tis Thou hast set me free;

To whom shall I give glory

Forever, but to Thee?

Of earthly love and blessing

Should every stream run dry,

Thy grace shall still be with me,

Thy grace, to live and die.
