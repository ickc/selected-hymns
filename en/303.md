# 303 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  O Jesus Lord, we come to Thee,

Thy presence to enjoy

Our entrance now with boldness is,

As we Thy blood employ.

Not by our merit do we stand,

Nor in our righteousness,

Thy blood and righteousness we need;

Their worth we now confess.

2.  Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,

Are holy, righteous, good.

We own our sins as crimson are,

We need Thy cleansing blood.

We have no argument, no plea;

No veil our sin can hide.

But, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood

Is to our sin applied!

3.  God has not overlooked our sin,

But judged it once for all;

His righteous fury, not on us,

But on His Lamb did fall.

A new and living way is made—

We stand on legal ground;

Our Surety and our Substitute

Has pardon for us found.

4.  Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,

Redemption now enjoy;

Thy precious blood again we see,

Its virtue now employ.

Dear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,

Unlimited and free.

Oh, Lamb of God, we’ll sing Thy praise,

Through all eternity!
