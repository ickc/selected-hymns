# 702 8.8.8.8.

1.  Just as I am, without one plea,

But that Thy blood was shed for me,

And that Thou bidâ€™st me come to Thee,

O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

2.  Just as I am, and waiting not

To rid my soul of one dark blot;

To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

3.  Just as I am, though tossed about

With many a conflict, many a doubt;

Fightings within, and fears without,

Lamb of God, I come, I come!

4.  Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

Sight, riches, healing of the mind;

Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

5.  Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;

Because Thy promise I believe,

Lamb of God, I come, I come!

6.  Just as I am, Thy love unknown

Has broken every barrier down;

Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,

Lamb of God, I come, I come!
