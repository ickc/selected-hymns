1.  Hark, the Savior’s knocking, knocking,

Knocking at your heart!

Oh, do not be hardened, hardened,

Lest He should depart.

Rise and open up your heart,

Quickly let Him in;

Life divine He’ll give you, give you,

And forgive your sin.

Let Him in! Let Him in!

He’s knocking at your heart;

Let Him in! Oh, let Him in!

Let Him in your heart.

2.  Why should you still tarry, tarry,

Keep Him waiting there?

He is kind and gracious, gracious,

Merciful and dear.

Listen to His tender voice,

Do not grieve His heart;

Won’t you let Him enter, enter,

And His grace impart.
