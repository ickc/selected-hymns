1.  I cannot breathe enough of Thee,

O gentle breeze of love;

More fragrant than the myrtle tree

The Henna-flower is to me,

The Balm of Heaven above.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

(No English translation)

3.  I cannot gaze enough on Thee,

Thou Fairest of the Fair;

My heart is filled with ecstasy,

As in Thy face of radiancy

I see such beauty there.

4.  I cannot yield enough to Thee,

My Savior, Master, Friend;

I do not wish to go out free,

But ever, always, willingly,

To serve Thee to the end.

5.  I cannot sing enough of Thee,

The sweetest name on earth;

A note so full of melody

Comes from my heart so joyously,

And fills my soul with mirth.

6.  I cannot speak enough of Thee,

I have so much to tell;

Thy heart it beats so tenderly

As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,

And whisper, “All is well.”
