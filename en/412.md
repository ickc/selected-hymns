1.  O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,

When shall I find my willing heart

All taken up by Thee?

My thirsty spirit faints to prove

The greatness of redeeming love,

The love of Christ to me.

2.  Stronger His love than death and hell,

Its riches are unsearchable:

The first-born sons of light

Desire in vain its depths to see;

They cannot reach the mystery,

The length, and breadth, and height.

3.  God only knows the love of God;

Oh, that it now were shed abroad

In this poor stony heart;

For love I sigh, for love I pine;

This only portion, Lord, be mine,

Be mine this better part.

4.  Oh, that I could forever sit

Like Mary, at the Master’s feet;

Be this my happy choice;

My only care, delight, and bliss,

My joy, my rest on earth be this,

To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.
