1.  Flow through me, Lord, a weak and earthly vessel,

Cleansed by Thy blood, and quickened at Thy call.

Flow through me, Lord, all utterly abandoned,

To Thy dear service, great, or high, or small.

2.  Flow through me, Lord, with overflowing fullness,

Make me to know Thine own deep love for souls.

Work in me, Lord, the faith that moveth mountains,

As power, Almighty power, my being holds.

3.  Flow through me, Lord, till sin in all its blackness

To captives bound by Satan is revealed.

Flow through me, Lord, till hearts are stricken, broken,

And in Thy cleansing fountain saved and healed.

4.  Flow through me, Lord, till lagging souls are quickened,

Till lives of failure sing the victory song,

Till praise from lips long dumb and silent, open,

And join with rapture earthâ€™s glad, cleansed throng.

5.  Flow through me, Lord, till waters from Thy fountain

Shall slake the thirst of souls in deserts drear.

Flow through me, Lord, till and places blossom

With roses fresh and sweet, and wondrous fair.

6.  Flow through me, Lord, set all my heart-strings thrilling,

With Thine own love, so matchless, perfect, free.

Flow through me, Lord, till naught in earth or heaven,

Can satisfy my being, Lord, but Thee.
