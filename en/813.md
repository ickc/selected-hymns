# 813 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  'Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,

Step by step and day by day;

Stepping in His very footprints,

Walking with Him all the way.

Step by step, step by step,

I would walk with Jesus,

All the day, all the way,

Keeping Step with Jesus.

2.  'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,

Leaning hard upon His arm,

Following closely where He leads us,

None can hurt and naught can harm.

3.  Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,

Just a moment at a time,

Heights I have not wings to soar to,

Step by step my feet can climb.

4.  All the way I'll walk with Jesus,

Through the sunshine, through the gloom,

Though His blood-marked steps may lead me

To the garden, to the tomb.

5.  Here a while we walk with Jesus,

But the time will not be long

Till the night shall change to morning,

And the sorrow into song.

6.  Then, with all who walked with Jesus,

We shall walk with Him in white,

While He turns our grief to gladness,

And our darkness into light.

7.  Jesus, keep me closerâ€”closer,

Step by step, and day by day;

Stepping in Thy very footprints,

Walking with Thee all the way.

Walking with Thee all the way.
