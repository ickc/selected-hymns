# 519 8.8.8.8.

1.  My will is weak, my strength is frail,

And all my hope is nearly gone;

I can but trust Thy working true

To gently hold and lead me on.

2.  I’ve tried my best, but still have failed,

E’en as before I’ve failed and erred;

Thy patience is my only trust

To hold and keep me to Thy word.

3.  Whene’er my heart is lifted up,

How very near I am to fall;

I dare not do, I dare not think,

I need Thyself in great or small.

4.  Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,

O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;

Though I’m the weakest of the weak,

My strength is nothing but Thy grace.
