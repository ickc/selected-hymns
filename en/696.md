# 696 11.11.11.7. with chorus

1.  “Whosoever heareth!” shout, shout the sound!

Send the blessed tidings all the world around;

Spread the joyful news wherever man is found:

“Whosoever will may come!”

“Whosoever will! whosoever will!”

Send the proclamation over vale and hill;

’Tis a loving Father calls the wand’rer home:

“Whosoever will may come!”

2.  “Whosoever cometh” need not delay,

Now the door is open, enter while you may;

Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:

“Whosoever will may come!”

3.  “Whosoever will!” the promise is secure;

“Whosoever will,” forever must endure;

“Whosoever will!” ’tis life forevermore;

“Whosoever will may come.”
