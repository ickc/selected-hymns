# 132 8.7.8.7.7.7. with chorus

1.  Hark! Ten thousand heav’nly voices

Sound the note of praise above;

Jesus reigns and heav’n rejoices,

Jesus reigns, the God of love.

See, He sits on yonder throne;

Jesus rules the world alone.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen.

2.  Sing how Jesus came from heaven,

How He bore the cross below,

How all power to Him is given,

How He reigns in glory now.

’Tis a great and endless theme—

Oh, ’tis sweet to sing of Him.

3.  Jesus, hail! Thy glory brightens

All above and gives it worth;

Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens,

Cheers, and charms Thy saints on earth.

When we think of love like Thine,

Lord, we own it love divine.

4.  King of glory, reign forever!

Thine ar, everlasting crown.

Nothing from Thy love shall sever

Those whom Thou hast made Thine own

Happy objects of Thy grace,

Destined to behold Thy face.

5.  Savior, hasten Thine appearing:

Heav’n and earth shall pass away.

Bring, oh, bring the glorious day,

When, the awful summons hearing.

Then with raptured hearts we’ll sing.

“Glory, glory to our King!”
