1.  Cleansed in our Savior’s precious Blood,

Filled with the fullness of our God,

Walking by faith the path He trod,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

2.  Leaning our heads on Jesus’ breast,

Knowing the joy of that sweet rest,

Finding in Him the chief, the best,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

3.  Kept by His pow’r from day to day,

Held by His hand, we cannot stray,

Glory to glory all the way,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

4.  Living in us His own pure life,

Giving us rest from inward strife,

From strength to strength, from death to life,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

5.  O what a Savior we have found;

Well may we make the world resound

With one continual joyous sound,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
