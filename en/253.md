# 253 9.8.8.9. with chorus

1.  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord,

Thou, the man, our Host, presiding,

In Thy house, Thy home, abiding;

Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Hallelujah for this feast!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

2.  How enjoyable Thy table, Lord!

As we fellowship around it,

Hallelujah, we have found it,

How enjoyable Thy table, Lord!

3.  Oh, how precious is Thy table, Lord—

Bread and wine Thy death announcing;

Here our soul-life we’re renouncing,

By partaking of Thy table, Lord.

4.  How significant Thy table, Lord—

We Thy Body in the loaf seen,

Object of Thy love bespeaking;

How significant Thy table, Lord!

5.  How refreshing is Thy table, Lord—

So completely satisfying,

Day by day our need supplying;

How refreshing is Thy table, Lord.

6.  How encouraging Thy table, Lord

“Till He come,” its promise giving

Hope, to fill our daily living;

How encouraging Thy table, Lord!
