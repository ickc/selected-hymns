# 367 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  He died for me that I might live;\
I live for Him who died,\
My life, my love to Him I give—\
Jesus, the Crucified.

O Jesus, my Lord and Savior,\
Help me to fully follow Thee

In life and death and loving service,\
As Thou hast lived and died for me.

2.  He died for me that I might die

To Satan, self, and sin;\
O death so deep! O life so high!\
Help me to enter in.

3.  He lives for me that I may live

As spotless e’en as He;

Savior, to me Thy nature give,

And live Thy life in me.

4.  He lives for me that I may give

His love to hearts that pine;\
Let me like Him for others live,\
And trace His steps divine.
