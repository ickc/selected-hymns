1.  Gracious God, we worship Thee,

Revâ€˜rently we bow the knee;

Jesus Christ, our only plea:

Father, we adore Thee.

2.  Vast Thy love, how deep, how wide,

In the gift of Him who died;

Righteous claims all satisfied:

Father, we adore Thee.

3.  Low we bow before Thy face,

Sons of God, O wondrous place;

Great the riches of Thy grace:

Father, we adore Thee.

4.  By Thy spirit grant that we

Worshipers in truth may be;

Praise, as incense sweet to Thee:

Father, we adore Thee.

5.  Yet again our song we raise,

Note of deep adoring praise;

Now, and soon through endless days:

Father, we adore Thee.
