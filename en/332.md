# 332 9.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  There is sunshine in my soul today,

More glorious and bright

Than glows in any earthly sky,

For Jesus is my light.

O thereâ€™s sunshine, blessed sunshine,

While the peaceful, happy moments roll;

When Jesus shows His Smiling face

There is sunshine in my soul.

2.  There is music in my soul today,

A carol to my King;

And Jesus, listening, can hear

The song I cannot sing.

3.  There is springtime in my soul today,

For when the Lord is near

The dove of peace sings in my heart,

The flowers of grace appear.

4.  There is gladness in my soul today,

And hope, and praise, and love,

For blessings which He gives me now,

For joys laid up above.
