# 558 7.6.7.6. with chorus

1.  Jesus, keep me near the cross,

There a precious fountain,

Free to all—a healing stream,

Flows from Calv’ry’s mountain.

In the cross, in the cross,

Be my glory ever;

Till my raptured soul shall find

Rest with Him forever.

2.  Near the cross, a trembling soul,

Love and mercy found me;

There the Bright and Morning Star

Sheds its beams around me.

3.  Near the cross! O Lamb of God,

Bring its scenes before me;

Help me walk from day to day,

With its shadow o’er me.

4.  Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,

Hoping, trusting ever,

Till I see my Savior’s face,

Leave His presence never.
