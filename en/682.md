# 682 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  O now I see the cleansing wave!

The fountain deep and wide;

Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,

Points to His wounded side.

The cleansing stream I see, I see;

I plunge, and O it cleanseth me!

O praise the Lord it cleanseth me!

It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

2.  I see the dear Redeemer raised,

I hear the speaking blood;

It speaks! My spirit is amazed!

And quickened by its flood.

3.  I rise to walk in Godâ€™s own light

Above the world and sin,

With heart renewed and garments white

And Christ enthroned within.
