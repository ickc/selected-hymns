# 576 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Precious promise God doth give thee,

Thou, the weary passerby,

On the way from earth to glory:

“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

I will guide thee, I will guide thee,

I will guide thee with Mine eye;

On the way from earth to glory,

I will guide thee with Mine eye.

2.  When temptations fierce assail thee,

When thy trusted helpers fly,

Let this promise ring within .thee,

“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

3.  When thy secret hopes have perished

In the grave of years gone by,

Let this promise still be cherished,

“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

4.  When the shades of life are falling,

And the hour has come to die,

Hear thy faithful Pilot calling,

“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
