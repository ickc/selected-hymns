# 342 11.8.11.8. with chorus

1.  A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

A wonderful Savior to me:

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,

Where rivers of pleasure I see.

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life in the depths of His love,

And covers me there with His hand,

And covers me there with his hand.

2.  A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

He taketh my burden away;

He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,

He giveth me strength as my day.

3.  With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,

And, filled with his fulness divine,

I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,

For such a Redeemer as mine!

4.  When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise

To meet Him in clouds of the sky,

His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,

Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.
