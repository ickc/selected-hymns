# 251 8.8.8.8.

1.  Is it Thy will that I should be

Buried, in symbol, Lord, with Thee;

Owning Thee by this solemn sign,

Telling the world that I am Thine?

2.  Gladly I yield obedience now;

In all things to Thy will I’d bow;

I’ll follow where my Savior led,

And humbly in His footsteps tread.

3.  This emblematic, watery grave

Shows forth His love—who came to save;

And as I enter it, I see

The price my Savior paid for me.

4.  Forth from Thy burial, Lord, I come,

For Thou hast triumphed o’er the tomb;

Thy resurrection life I share—

My portion is no longer here.

5.  Oh, may I count myself to be

Dead to the sins that wounded Thee,

Dead to the pleasures of this earth,

Unworthy of my heav’nly birth.

6.  Lord Jesus, when I gaze on Thee,

And all Thy radiant glory see,

That joy will far exceed the shame

I bear on earth for Thy loved name.
