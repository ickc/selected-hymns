# 236 6.6.8.6.

1.  I love Thy kingdom, Lord,

The house of Thine abode,

The Church our blest Redeemer bought

With His own precious blood.

2.  I love the Church, O God!

Her walls before Thee stand,

Dear as the apple of Thine eye

And graven on Thy hand.

3.  For her my tears shall fall,

For her my prayers ascend;

To her my cares and toils be given

Till toils and cares shall end.

4.  Beyond my highest joy

I prize her heavenly ways,

Her sweet communion, solemn vows,

Her hymns of love and praise.

5.  Sure as Thy truth shall last,

To Zion shall be given

The brightest glories earth can yield,

And brighter bliss of heaven.
