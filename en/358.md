1.  More love to Thee, O Christ,

More love to Thee!

Hear Thou the prayer I make

On bended knee;

This is my earnest plea:

More love, O Christ, to Thee,

More love to Thee, More love to Thee.

2.  Once earthly joy I craved,

Sought peace and rest;

Now Thee alone I seek,

Give what is best;

This all my prayer shall be:

More love, O Christ, to Thee,

More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

3.  Let sorrow do its work,

Send grief and pain;

Sweet are Thy messengers,

Sweet their refrain,

When they can sing with me:

More love, O Christ, to Thee,

More love to Thee, More love to Thee!

4.  Then shall my latest breath

Whisper Thy praise;

This be the parting cry

My heart shall raise;

This still its prayer shall be:

More love, O Christ, to Thee,

More love to Thee, More love to Thee!
