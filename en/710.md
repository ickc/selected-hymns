# 710 9.7.9.7. with chorus

1.  Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,

Come into my heart, I pray;

My soul is so troubled and weary,

Come into my heart, today.

Into my heart, into my heart,

Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;

Come in today, come in to stay,

Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.

2.  Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,

I need Thee through lifeâ€™s dreary way;

The burden of sin is so heavy,

Come into my heart to stay.

3.  Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,

Now cleanse and illumine my soul;

Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,

Come in and take full control.
