# 351 10.6.10.6. with chorus

1.  Down from His splendor in glory He came,

Into a world of woe;

Took on Himself all my guilt and my shame,

Why should He should He love me so?

How can I help but love Him,

When He loved me so?

How can I help but love Him,

When He loved me so?

2.  I am unworthy to take of His grace,

Wonderful grace so free;

Yet Jesus suffered and died in my place,

Eâ€™en for a soul like me.

3.  He is the fairest of thousands to me,

His love is sweet and true;

Wonderful beauty in Him I now see,

More than I ever knew.
