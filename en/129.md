1.  Jesus, Thou alone art worthy

Ceaseless praises to receive;

For Thy love and grace and goodness

Rise o’er all our thoughts conceive.

2.  With adoring heart, we render

Honor to Thy precious name,

Overflowing with Thy mercies,

Far and wide Thy worth proclaim.

5.  Praise Him! praise Him! praise the Savior!

Saints, aloud your voices raise,

Praise Him! praise Him! till in glory

Perfected we’ll sing His praise.
