# 848 11.11.12.11. with chorus

1.  I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,

A dear, loving Savior, tho’ earth-friends be few;

And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,

But O, that my Savior were your Savior too!

For you I am praying,

For you I am praying,

I’m praying for you.

2.  I have a Father; to me He has given

A hope for eternity, blessed and true;

And soon He will call me to meet Him in Heaven,

But O, that He'd let me bring you with me too!

3.  I have a joy, rolling as the sea billows,

Since Jesus my Savior took my sins away;

And now He lives in me-what joy divine o'erflows!

But O, that He'd give you this same joy today.

4.  I have a peace; it is calm as a river,

A peace that the friends of this world never knew;

My Savior alone is its author and giver,

And O, could I know it was given for you!

5.  When He has found you, tell others the story,

That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;

Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory,

And prayer will be answered—'twas answered for you!
