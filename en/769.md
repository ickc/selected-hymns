(No English translation)

1.  What grace, O Lord, and and beauty shone

Around Thy steps below!

What patient love was seen in all

Thy life and death of woe!

2.  Forever on Thy burdened heart

A weight of sorrow hung,

Yet no ungentle, murm'ring word

Escaped Thy silent tongue.

3.  Thy foes did hate, despise, revile,

Thy friends Unfaithful prove;

Unwearied in forgiveness still,

Thy heart could only love!
