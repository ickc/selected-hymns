1.  Jesus! how much Thy name unfolds

To ev’ry opened ear;

The pardoned sinner’s mem’ry holds

None other half so dear.

2.  Thy name encircles every grace

That God as man could show;

There only could He fully trace

A life divine below.

3.  Jesus—it speaks a life of love,

Of sorrows meekly home;

It tells of sympathy above,

Whatever makes us mourn.

4.  Jesus, the One who knew no sin,

Made sin to make us just;

Thou gav’st Thyself our love to win,

Our full confiding trust.

5.  The mention of Thy name shall bow

Our hearts to worship Thee;

The chiefest of ten thousand Thou,

Whose love has set us free.
