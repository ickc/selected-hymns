# 032 8.6.8.6.

1.  Father, Thy name our souls would bless,

As children taught by grace,

Lift up our hearts in righteousness,

And joy before Thy face.

2.  Sweet is the confidence Thou giv’st,

Though high above our praise;

Our hearts resort to where Thou liv’st

In heaven’s unclouded rays.

3.  There in the purpose of Thy love,

Our place is now prepared;

As sons with Him who is above,

In bright etemity.

4.  Eternal ages shall declare,

The riches of Thy grace,

To those who with Thy Son shall share

A son’s eternal place.

5.  Absent as yet, we rest in hope,

Treading the desert path,

Waiting for Him who takes us up

Beyond the pow’r of death.

6.  We joy in Thee, Thy fullness shall

Our endless portion be,

Like Thine own Son, with whom we’ll dwell

Who all our sorrows shared.

7.  O Holy Father, keep us here

In that blest name of love,

Walking before Thee without fear,

Thy perfect will to prove.
