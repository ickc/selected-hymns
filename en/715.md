# 715 9.9.9.5. with chorus

1.  Down at the cross where my Savior died,

Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,

There to my sin was the blood applied;

Glory to His name!

Glory to His name,

Glory to His name;

There to my sin was the blood applied;

Glory to His name!

2.  I am so wondrously saved from sin,

Jesus so sweetly abides within;

There at the cross where He took me in;

Glory to His name.

3.  Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,

I am so glad I have entered in;

There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;

Glory to His name.

4.  Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;

Cast thy poor soul at the Saviorâ€™s feet;

Plunge in today, and be made complete;

Glory to His name.
