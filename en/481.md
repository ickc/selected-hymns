# 481 8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6.

1.  My heart is fixed, eternal God,

Fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee;

And my immortal choice is made,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

He is my prophet, priest, and king,

Who did for me salvation bring,

And while I’ve breath I’mean to sing,

Christ for me, Christ for me.

2.  In Him I see the Godhead shine,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

He is the majesty divine,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

The Father’s well-beloved Son,

Co-partner of His royal throne,

Who bore the guilt of man alone,

Christ for me, Christ for me.

3.  Let others boast of heaps of gold,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

His riches never can be told,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

Your gold will waste and wear away,

Your honors perish in a day;

My portion never can decay,

Christ for me, Christ for me.

4.  In pining sickness, or in health,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

In deepest poverty or wealth,

Christ for me, Christ for me;

And in that all-important day,

When I the summons must obey,

And pass from this dark world away,

Christ for me, Christ for me.
