# 141 8.6.8.6.

1.  Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?

O height, O depth of love!

Thou one with us on Calvary,

We one Thee above.

2.  Such was Thy grace that for our sake

Thou didst from heaven come down,

With us of flesh and blood partake,

In all our misery one.

3.  Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine

Confessed and home by Thee;

The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,

To set Thy members free.

4.  Ascended now, in glory bright,

Head of the Church Thou art;

Nor life nor death, nor depth nor height,

Thy saints and Thee can part.

5.  Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own

This wondrous mystery,

That Thou in heaven with us art one,

And we are one with Thee.

6.  Soon, soon shall come that glorious day

When, seated on Thy throne,

Thou shalt to wondering worlds display

That Thou with us art one.
