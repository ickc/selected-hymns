# 182 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  What a glory! What a blessing!

Now the Spirit dwells in me;

Testifying, truth revealing,

Shining, leading constantly.

Fill me, Lord! Fill me, Lord!

Fill me with Thy Spirit now;

Make me empty, strip me thoroughly,

Fill me with Thy Spirit now!

2.  Word of promise, real within me,

Life divine now freeing me

From sin’s cruel control releasing,

From death’s power setting free.

3.  Deepest springs of life desiring,

Like the hart I thirst for Thee;

May I drink, Lord, of Thy fullness

Till Thy river flows through me.

4.  May my self be put to death, Lord,

Till I’m fully filled by Thee;

Transformed to Thy glorious image,

I’d forever flow out Thee.
