# 434 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  Utterly abandoned To the Holy Ghost!

Seeking all His fulness At whatever cost;

Cutting all the shorelines, Launching in the deep

Of His mighty power, Strong to save and keep.

Utterly abandoned To the Lord of all,

Seeking all His fulness, Answ’ring His dear call.

2.  Utterly abandoned To the Holy Ghost!

Oh! the sinking, sinking, Till the self is lost!

Till the vessel’s emptied Broken at His feet;

Waiting till His filling Makes the work complete.

3.  Utterly abandoned To the will of God;

Walking in the pathway That my Master trod;

Leaving ease and pleasure; Making Him my’choice,

Waiting for His guidance, Listening for His voice.

4.  Utterly abandoned! Through eternity;

My will never choosing, His it e’er shall be;

All my plans and longings Lost in His sweet will,

Having nothing, owning All things in Him still.

5.  Utterly abandoned! ’Tis so sweet to be

Captive in His love-bonds, Yet so wondrous free;

Free from sin’s dominion, Free from doubt and fear,

Free from every worry, Burden, grief or care.

6.  Utterly abandoned! Oh, the rest is sweet,

Waiting in His presence At His blessed feet;

Waiting for the filling Of the Host divine,

Who my inward parts shall Perfectly refine.

7.  Lo! His Spirit fills me, With His presence sweet!

I, in Him, am blessed! I, in Him, complete!

Now the light within me Never shall grow dim

While abandoned ever, Living unto Him!
