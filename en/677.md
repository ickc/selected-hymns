# 677 9.9.9.9. with chorus

1.  Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,

Died for the sinner, paid all his due;

Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb,

“And I will pass, will pass over you.”

“When I see the blood,

When I see the blood,

When I see the blood,

I will pass, I will pass over you.”

2.  Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;

All He has promised, that will He do;

Wash in the fountain opened for sin,

“And I will pass, will pass over you.”

3.  Judgment is coming, all will be there,

Each one receiving justly his due;

Hide in the saving, sin-cleansing blood,

“And I will pass, will pass over you.”

4.  O great compassion! O boundless love!

O loving kindness, faithful and true!

Find peace and shelter under the blood,

“And I will pass, will pass over you.”
