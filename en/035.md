1.  Our God and Father, we respond to Thee

As sons brought near,

Suited, in love and holy liberty,

To this blest sphere.

O wondrous thought, that many there should be

Like Christ, for Thy delight eternally!

2.  He, Thy delight, in whom we have our part,

Through grace to share

Thy love for Him, the object of Thy heart

Beyond compare.

His glory in Thy presence now we see,

As with Him there in love’s complacency.

3.  ’Tis here He sings—what joy His heart doth find,

Thyself to praise,

While many sons are stirred in heart and mind

One voice to raise

In worship, God and Father, unto Thee,

Supreme, Thou Source in love’s economy!
