1.  My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,

And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;

He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,

Within the holiest at home with God.

O holy place! O home divinely fair!

And we, God’s little ones, abiding there.

2.  A long, long road I traveled night and day,

And sought to find within myself some way,

Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;

Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,

And then I found Christ was the only way

That I must come to Him and in Him stay.

3.  O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!

And I, God’s little one, safe hidden there.

Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,

So make me dead to everything but Thee;

That as I rest within my home most fair,

I’ll share my God in all and everywhere.
