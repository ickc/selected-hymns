# 487 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,

And found in Thee alone,

The peace, the joy I sought so long,

The bliss till now unknown.

Now none but Christ can satisfy,

None other name for me;

There’s love and life and lasting joy,

Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

2.  I sighed for rest and happiness,

I yearned for them, not Thee;

But, while I passed my Savior by,

His love laid hold on me.

3.  I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,

But, ah, the waters failed!

E’en as ! stooped to drink they fled,

And mocked me as I wailed.

4.  The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,

But never wept for Thee,

Till grace the sightless eyes received,

Thy loveliness to see.
