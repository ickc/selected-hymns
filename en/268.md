# 268 6.6.6.6.D.

1.  Shine Thou upon us, Lord,

True Light of men, today,

And through the written Word

Thy very self display;

That so from hearts which burn

With gazing on Thy face,

Thy little ones may learn

The wonders of Thy grace.

2.  Breathe Thou upon us, Lord,

Thy Spirit’s living flame,

That so with one accord

Our lips may tell Thy name;

Give Thou the hearing ear,

Fix Thou the wandering thought,

That those we teach may hear

The great things Thou hast wrought.

3.  Speak Thou for us, O Lord,

In all we say of Thee;

According to Thy Word

Let all our teaching be;

That so Thy lambs may know

Their own true Shepherd’s voice,

Where’er He leads them go,

And in His love rejoice.

4.  Live Thou within us, Lord;

Thy mind and will be ours;

Be Thou beloved, adored,

And served with all our powers;

That so our lives may teach

Thy children what Thou art,

And plead, by more than speech,

For Thee with every heart.
