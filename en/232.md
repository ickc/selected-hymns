# 232 6.6.8.6.

1.  Blest be the tie that binds

Our hearts in Christian love,

The fellowship our spirit finds

Is like to that above.

2.  Before our Father’s throne,

We pour our ardent pray’rs;

Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one--

Our comforts and our cares.

3.  We share our mutual woes;

Our mutual burdens bear;

And often for each other flows

The sympathizing tear.

4.  When we asunder part,

It gives us inward pain;

But we shall still be joined in heart,

And hope to meet again.

5.  From sorrow, toil, and pain,

And sin we shall be free;

And perfect love and oneness reign

Through all eternity.
