# 201 6.4.6.4.D.

1.  Break Thou the Bread of Life,

Dear Lord, to me,

As Thou didst break the loaves

Beside the sea;

Beyond the sacred page

I seek Thee, Lord;

My spirit pants for Thee,

O Living Word.

2.  Thou art the Bread of Life,

O Lord, to me,

Thy holy Word the truth

That saveth me;

Give me to eat and live

With Thee above;

Teach me to love Thy truth,

For Thou art Love.

3.  Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord,

Now unto me,

That He may touch my eyes,

And make me see;

Show me the truth concealed

Within Thy Word,

And in Thy Book revealed

I see the Lord.

4.  Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,

To me, to me,

As Thou didst bless the bread

By Galilee;

Then shall all bondage cease,

All fetters fall,

And I shall find my peace,

My All in all.
