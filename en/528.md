1.  When God created man on earth,

He by His image gave

His treasure in creation see:

His image in humanity.

That God is love could then be known;

That He is light would then be

His holy nature, righteous ways

Would shine in men through all their days.

2.  The fall these human virtues soiled;

God’s vessel then seemed hopeless, spoiled.

But Christ, the God-Man-Savior came

These human virtues to reclaim.

He lived a human life so fine,

Strengthened and filled with life divine,

Expressing God in every part,

Then came to dwell within our heart!

3.  Now He is all that we require

That God may have His heart’s desire:

Himself expressed in mankind see

Through our restored humanity.

Yes, He is everything we need

The image-reproducing seed;

He’s now been sown into our heart,

His human virtues to impart.

4.  If we behold Him every day,

He’ll as the Spirit have His way:

Our inward parts He will transform,

And to His image us conform.

Take every opportunity

To drink of His humanity;

Transforming Spirit to bring in

Until we shine, expressing Him.
