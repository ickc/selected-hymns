1.  Jesus, my Savior, is all things to me;\
Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He,\
Guiding, protecting, o’er life’s rolling sea,\
Mighty Deliv’rer—Jesus for me.

Jesus for me, Jesus for me,\
All the time everywhere, Jesus for me.

2.  Jesus in sickness, and Jesus in health,

Jesus in poverty, comfort or wealth;

Sunshine or tempest, whatever it be,

He is my safety—Jesus for me.

3.  He is my Refuge, my Rock, and my Tower,

He is my Fortress, my Strength and my Pow’r;

Life everlasting, my Daysman is He,

Blessed Redeemer—Jesus for me.

4.  He is my Prophet, my Priest and my King,

He is my Bread of Life, Fountain and Spring;

Bright Sun of Righteousness, Daystar is He,

Horn of Salvation—Jesus for me.

5.  Jesus in sorrow, in joy, or in pain,

Jesus my Treasure in loss or in gain;

Constant Companion where’er I may be,

Living or dying—Jesus for me.
