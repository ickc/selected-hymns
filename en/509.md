# 509 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus

1.  I have learned the wondrous secret

Of abiding in the Lord;

I have tasted life’s pure fountain,

I am drinking of His word;

I have found the strength and sweetness

Of abiding ‘neath the blood;

I have lost myself in Jesus,

I am sinking into God.

I’m abiding in the Lord

And confiding in His word;

I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

Yes, abiding in the Lord

And confiding in His word,

I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

2.  I am crucified with Jesus,

And He lives and dwells with me;

I have ceased from all my struggling,

’Tis no longer I, but He.

All my will is yielding to Him,

And His Spirit reigns within;

And His precious blood each moment

Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.

3.  All my sicknesses I bring Him,

And He bears them all away;

All my fears and griefs I tell Him,

All my cares from day to day,

All my strength I draw from Jesus,

By His breath I live and move;

E’en His very mind He gives me,

And His faith, and life, and love.

4.  For my words I take His wisdom,

For my works His Spirit’s power;

For my ways His ceaseless presence

Guards and guides me every hour.

Of my heart, He is the portion,

Of my joy the boundless spring;

Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,

Glorious Lord, and coming King.
