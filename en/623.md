# 623 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  To the foe my word is always, “No,”

To the Father it is “Yes,”

That His plan and all His counsel

Be accomplished with success;

When Thine orders I’m obeying,

Grant me, Lord, authority

To fulfill Thy plan eternal

Thru the Spirit’s power in me.

2.  To the foe my word is always, “No,”

To the Father it is, “Yes”;

’Tis my attitude eternal;

May the Lord protect and bless,

Lest while walking in obedience

Satan undermine the way;

When I’m list’ning to Thine orders,

Grant me mercy, Lord, I pray.

3.  To the foe my word is always, “No,”

To the Father it is, “Yes”;

I completely would obey Him,

Though deep suff’ring may oppress.

If the Lord will save and keep me,

As I forward press with Him,

Then no trials shall prevent me,

Nor will opposition grim.
