# 027 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  “Abba, Father,” We approach Thee

In our Savior’s precious name.

We, Thy Children, here assembling,

Now the promised blessing claim.

From our guilt His blood has washed us,

“Tis thro’ Him our sould draw nigh,

And Thy Spirit too has taught us

“Abba, Father,” thus to cry.

2.  Once as prodigals we wandered,

In our folly, far from Thee;

But Thy grace, o’er sin abounding,

Rescued us from misery.

Clothed in garments of salvation

At Thy table is our place;

We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,

In the riches of Thy grace.

3.  Thou the prodigal hast pardoned,

“Kissed us” with a Father’s love;

“Killed the fatted calf,” and made us

Fit Thy purpose to approve.

“It is meet,” we hear Thee saying,

“We should merry be and glad;

I have found My once-lost children,

Now they live who once were dead.”

4.  “Abba, Father,” we adore Thee,

While the hosts in heaven above

E’en in us now learn the wonders

Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love.

Soon before Thy throne assembled,

All Thy children shall proclaim

Abba’s love as shown in Jesus,

And how full is Abba’s name!
