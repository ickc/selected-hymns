# 522 11.11.11.11. with chorus

1.  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,

Anywhere He leads me in this world below,

Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;

Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

2.  Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,

Other friends may fail me, He is still my own.

Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,

Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

3.  Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,

When the darkling shadows round about me creep;

Knowing I shall waken never more to roam,

Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
