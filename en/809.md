# 809 6.6.8.6.

1.  The Lord my shepherd is,

I shall be well supplied:

Since He is mine, and I am His,

What can I want beside?

2.  He leads me to the place

Where heav'nly pasture grows,

Where living waters gently pass

And full salvation flows.

3.  If e'er I go astray,

He doth my soul reclaim;

And guides me in His own right way,

For His most holy name.

4.  While He affords His aid,

I cannot yield to fear;

Tho' I should walk thro' death's dark

My Shepherd's with me there.

5.  In spite of all my foes,

Thou dost my table spread;

My cup with blessings overflows,

And joy exalts my head.

6.  The bounties of Thy love

Shall crown my future days;

Nor from Thy house will I remove,

Nor cease to speak Thy praise.
