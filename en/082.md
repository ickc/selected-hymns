1.  Lamb of God so pure and spotless,

Lamb of God for sinners slain.

Thy shed blood has wrought redemption,

Cleansing us from every stain,

Lamb redeeming, Lamb redeeming,

Bearing all our sins away,

Bearing all our sins away!

2.  Brazen serpent, to Thee looking,

Son of Man, uplifted high.

Thou didst bear the flesh of sin in

Likeness on the cross to die.

Old creation’s termination;

Finished, Satan and the world,

Finished, Satan and the world!

3.  Grain of wheat, so small and lowly.

Without death abides alone;

Life divine enclosed within it,

Into death it must be sown.

Life releasing, Christ increasing,

Many grains to bring to birth,

Many grains to bring to birth!

4.  Lamb of God—our soul’s redemption,

Brazen serpent—Satan’s end,

Grain of wheat—life’s reproduction,

Now with many grains we blend.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

What an all-inclusive death,

What an all-inclusive death!
