# 319 8.7.8.7.

1.  Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing,

Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;

Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

Call for songs of loudest praise.

2.  Jesus sought me when a stranger,

Wand’ring from the fold of God;

He to save my soul from danger,

Interposed His precious blood.

3.  Oh to grace how great a debtor

Daily I’m constrained to be!

Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,

Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

4.  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;

Prone to leave the God I love;

Take my heart, Oh, take and seal it

With Thy Spirit from above.

5.  Rescued thus from sin and danger,

Purchased by the Savior’s blood,

May I walk on earth a stranger,

As a son and heir of God.
