1.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Now to Thy saints appear!

Oh, speak with power to evâ€™ry soul,

And let Thy people hear!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!

While here to Thee we bow;

Descend, O gracious Lord, descend!

Oh, come, and bless us now!

2.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And every soul inspire;

Oh, kindle in each heart, we pray,

The Pentecostal fire!

3.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Exalt Thy precious name!

And may Thy love in every heart

Be kindled to a flame!

4.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And bless to all Thy Word!

And may its pure and sacred truth

In living faith be heard!

5.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

And make Thy servants bold;

Convict of sin and work once more

As in the days of old.

6.  Revive Thy work, O Lord!

Give Pentecostal showers!

Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!

The blessing, Lord, be ours!
