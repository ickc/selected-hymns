1.  This is the time for building the temple of the Lord

That all the golden lampstands may fully be restored.

’Tis not the time for our house while God’s house lieth waste—

O brothers, for God’s building, rise up, make haste!

Be strong, be strong, God’s dwelling place to build!

The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory ‘twill be filled!

Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,

That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.

2.  O hear, the Lord is speaking: Consider now your ways,

Ye sow and bring in little, for lacking is My praise.

Go up into the mountain, material to provide,

And build My house that I may be glorified.

3.  Ye who are priests, ye remnant of Christians now obey—

The Lord Himself is with us, whatever men may say,

With spirits stirred and burning, now let us come to work;

May none his part with others in building shirk.

4.  I’ll fill this house with glory, the Lord of hosts has said,

And the desire of nations will be exhibited.

Its glory will be greater than all that’s gone before,

And we will share this glory forevermore.
