# 822 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  Have you felt the Father's love?

Still there's more to follow;

And His mercy have you proved?

Still there's more to follow.

Oh, the love the Father shows,

Still there's more to follow;

Freely He His love bestows,

Still there's more to follow.

More and more, more and more,

Always more to follow;

Oh, His matchless, boundless love,

Still there's more to follow.

2.  Have you felt the Savior near?

Still there's more to follow;

Does His blessed presence cheer?

Still there's more to follow.

Oh, the grace that Jesus shows,

Still there's more to follow;

Freely He His grace bestows,

Still there's more to follow.

3.  Have you felt the Spirit's power?

Still there's more to follow;

Falling like the gentle shower?

Still there's more to follow.

Oh, the power the Spirit shows,

Still there's more to follow;

Freely He His power bestows,

Still there's more to follow.
