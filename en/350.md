1.  O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!

Forgive me if I say,

For very love, Thy sacred name

A thousand times a day.

O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;

I rest in Thee, whate’er betide;

Thy gracious smile is my reward;

I love, I love Thee, Lord.!

2.  I love Thee so I know not how

My transports to control;

Thy love is like a burning fire

Within my very soul.

3.  For Thou to me art all in all;

My honor and my wealth;

My heart’s desire, my body’s strength,

My soul’s eternal health.

4.  Burn, bum, O love, within my heart,

Burn fiercely night and day,

Till all the dross of earthly loves

Is burned, and burned away.

5.  O light in darkness, joy in grief,

O heaven’s life on earth;

Jesus, my love, my treasure, who

Can tell what Thou art worth?

6.  What limit is them to this love?

Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?

On, on! our Lord is sweeter far

Today than yesterday.
