# 312 6.6.6.6. with chorus

1.  Dear Savior, Thou art mine,

How sweet the thought to me;

Let me repeat Thy name,

And lift my heart to Thee.

Mine! Mine! Mine!

I know Thou art mine;

Savior, dear Savior,

I know Thou art mine.

2.  Thou art the sinner’s friend,

So I Thy friendship claim,

A sinner saved by grace,

When Thy sweet message came.

3.  My hardened heart was touched;

Thy pard’ning voice I heard;

And joy and peace came in

While list’ning to Thy word.

4.  So let me sing Thy praise,

So let me call Thee mine.

I cannot doubt Thy word,

I know that I am Thine.
