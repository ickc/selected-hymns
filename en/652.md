1.  Hail to the Lord’s Anointed,

Great David’s greater Son!

Hail, in the time appointed,

His reign on earth begun!

He comes to break oppression,

To set the captive free;

To take away transgression,

And rule in equity.

2.  He shall come down like showers

Upon the fruitful earth;

And love, joy, hope, like flowers,

Spring in His path to birth:

Before Him on the mountains

Shall peace, the herald, go;

And righteousness, in fountains,

From hill to valley flow.

3.  Kings shall fall down before Him,

And gold and incense bring;

All nations shall adore Him,

His praise all people sing;

For He shall have dominion

O’er river, sea, and shore,

Far as the eagle’s pinion,

Or dove’s light wing can soar.

4.  To Him shall prayer unceasing

And daily vows ascend;

His kingdom still increasing,

A kingdom without end.

The mountain dews shall nourish

A seed in weakness sown,

Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,

And shake like Lebanon.

5.  O’er every foe victorious

He on His throne shall rest,

From age to age more glorious,

All-blessing and all-blest.

The tide of time shall never

His covenant remove;

His Name shall stand forever,

His changeless Name of Love.
