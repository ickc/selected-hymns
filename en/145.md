# 145 11.12.12.12.

1.  With praise and thanksgiving there

stands a great throng

In the presence of Jesus and sing

this new song.

Unto Him Who hath lov’d us and

wash’d us from sin,

Unto Him be the glory forever!

Amen!

2.  All these once were sinners,

defiled in His sight,

Now arrayed in pure garments, in

praise they unite.

3.  He maketh the rebel a priest

and a king,

He hath bought us, and taught us

this new song to sing.

4.  How helpless and hopeless

we sinners had been,

If He never had loved us till cleansed

from our sin.

5.  Aloud in His praises our voices

shall ring,

So that others, believing, this new

song shall sing.
