# 390 10.7.10.7. with chorus

1.  I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,

And it told Thy love to me;

But I long to rise in the arms of faith,

And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To the cross where Thou hast died;

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To Thy precious, bleeding side.

2.  Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,

By the powâ€™r of grace divine;

Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,

And my will be lost in Thine.

3.  O the pure delight of a single hour

That before Thy throne I spend,

When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,

I commune as friend with friend!

4.  There are depths of love that I yet may know

Till Thy blessed face I see;

There are heights of joy that I yet may reach

Till I rest in peace with Thee.
