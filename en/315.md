# 315 8.8.8.6. with chorus

1.  In loving kindness Jesus came

My soul in mercy to reclaim,

And from the depths of sin and shame

Thro’ grace He lifted me.

From sinking sand He lifted me,

With tender hand He lifted me,

From shades of night to plains of light,

Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!

2.  He called me long before I heard,

Before my sinful heart was stirred,

But when I took Him at His word,

Forgiv’n, He lifted me.

3.  His brow was pierced with many a thom,

His hands by cruel nails were tom,

When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,

In love He lifted me.

4.  Now on a higher plane I dwell,

And with my soul I know ’tis well;

Yet how or why, I cannot tell,

He should have lifted me.
