# 795 6.6.8.6.6. with chorus

1.  Come, ye that love the Lord,

And let your joys be known,

Join in a song with sweet accord,

And thus surround the throne.

Rejoice! His grace is free!

Rejoice! His grace is free!

Full pardon granted, grace is free!,

Rejoice! His grace is free.

2.  Let those refuse to sing

Who never knew our God;

But children of the heav'nly King,

Must speak their joys abroad.

3.  The hill of Zion yields

A thousand sacred sweets,

Before we reach the heav'nly fields,

Or walk the golden streets.

4.  Then let our songs abound,

And every tear be dry;

We're marching through Immanuel's ground,

To fairer worlds on high.
