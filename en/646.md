1.  Lord, Thou wilt soon appear, Thy day is almost here.

Oh, how we love Thy coming soon! We have no other

Lord, life, or lover Than Thou, Lord Jesus, our Bridegroom!

And see Thee in the clouds descend. Oh what an hour sweet

When Bride and Bridegroom meet

And love surpassing comprehend.

Amen, Lord Jesus! Quickly come! We long Thyself to see

And with Thee ever be,

Thou who our inmost heart hath won.

Soon wilt return to claim Thy Bride.

O Hallelujah! ’Tis this we long for,

And Thou too wilt be satisfied.
