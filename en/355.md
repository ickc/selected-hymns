# 355 7.7.7.7.D. with chorus

1.  Jesus, Lord, you’re our first love;

You’re the One we love the best.

When our heart is loving You,

How we’re filled with Your sweet rest!

Lord, we love You for Yourself,

Not for what You give or do.

Nothing else could e’er compare

With the joy of loving You.

Lord, we’ve been drawn off by many things;

Now we turn our heart back—how it sings!

We repent of loving other things—

Jesus, Lord, You’re our first love.

(Repeat the first eight lines)

2.  Never more could we desire

Anything that’s less than You,

And to this we will aspire—

Simply to be filled with You.

Jesus, Lord, You’re our first love;

You’re the One we love the best.

When our bean is loving You,

How we’re filled with Your sweet rest!

(Do not repeat chorus)
