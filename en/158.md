1.  We come, O Christ, to Thee,

True Son of God and man,

By whom al things consist,

In whom all life began:

In Thee alone we live and move

And have our being in Thy love.

2.  Thou art the Way to God,

Thy blood our ransom paid;

In Thee we face our Judge

And Maker unafraid.

Before the Throne absolved we stand:

Thy love has met Thy lawâ€™s demand.

3.  Thou art the living Truth!

All wisdom dwells in Thee,

Thou Source of every skill,

Eternal Verity!

Thou great I Am! In Thee we rest,

True answer to our every quest.

4.  Thou only art true Life,

To know Thee is to live

The more abundant life

That earth can never give:

O Risen Lord! We live in Thee

And Thou in us eternally!

5.  We worship Thee Lord Christ,

Our Savior and our King,

To Thee our youth and strength

Adoringly we bring:

So fill our hearts that men may see

Thy life in us and turn to Thee!
