1.  Oh, hallelujah, what a death

Christ died upon the cross!

Not only was he dying there

But everything that death did share:

God was included too,

All men with me and you—

Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!

2.  Oh, praise the Lord, man died in God

And to an end was brought!

Now from this man I’m wholly free

For God has terminated me!

Oh, what a wondrous death,

Oh, what a wondrous death;

Oh, hallelujah, for such a death!

3.  Oh, praise the Lord, God died in man,

In man to be released.

The grain of wheat fell to the ground,

And now a multitude is found

Filled with the life of God,

Filled with the life of God;

Oh, hallelujah, for such a life!

4.  Lord, how we praise You for Your cross,

Your all-inclusive death!

The center of the universe,

It has untold, eternal worth!

Lord, how we love Your cross,

Lord, how we love Your cross;

Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!
