1.  Oh, how I love this blessed Book!

The story of redeeming grace,

Love letter of my Bridegroom’s heart

And mirror of my Savior’s face.

2.  Oh, how I love this blessed Book!

My checkbook on the bank above,

Deed of my heavenly heritage

And dying will of Him I love.

3.  Oh, how I love this blessed Book!

Bright telescope through which I view

The wonders of the world to come

And gaze on glories ever new.

4.  Oh, how I love this blessed Book!

My Guide Book all my earthly way,

The lamp that cheers my darkest night,

The sunshine of my brightest day.
