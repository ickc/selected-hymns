# 583 11.11.11.11. with chorus

1.  When sorrows and storms are besetting my track,

And Satan is whip’ring “You’d better go back,”

Oh, then I have prov’d it tho’ dark be the way,

A little believing drives clouds right away.

Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe!

Savior, raise my faith in Thee till it can move a mountain.

Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe!

All my doubts I’ll bury in the Fountain.

2.  How easy when sailing the sea at a calm

To trust in the strength of Jehovah’s great arm,

But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat,

It takes some believing to keep things afloat.

3.  “I’ll stand to the end,” I have heard people say,

“I’ll fight till I die, and I’ll ne’er run away;”

But when the temptations so fiercely assailed,

They left off believing, and terribly failed.

4.  And others there are full of courage and zeal,

Who go to the battle like warriors of steel;

But right in the heat of the conflict with sin,

Instead of believing, they faint and give in.

5.  Oh, let us remember, in running our race,

That faith is not feeling, and trust is not trace;

And when all is seeming as black as the night,

We’ll keep on believing, and go on with the fight.
