1.  O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;

This is my constant longing and prayer;

Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures,

Jesus,Thy perfect likeness to wear.

O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!

Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;

Come in Thy sweetness, come inThy fullness;

StampThine own image deep on my heart.

2.  O to be like Thee! full of compassion,

Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,

Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,

Seeking the wand’ring sinners to find.

3.  O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,

Now to receive th’ anointing divine;

All that I am and have I am bringing;

Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

4.  O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,

Holy and harmless, patient and brave;

Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,

Willing to suffer, others to save.

5.  O to be like Thee! While I am pleading

Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.

Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,

Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.
