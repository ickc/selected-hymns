1.  While fighting for my Savior here,

the devil tries me hard;

He uses all his mighty pow’r,

my progress to retard;

He’s up to ev’ry move,

And yet thro’ all I prove

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right,

In trials of ev’ry kind, praise God

I always find,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

2.  Tho' dark the night and clouds

look black and stormy overhead,

And trials of almost ev'ry kind

across my path are spread;

How soon I conquer all,

As to the Lord I call,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

3.  When those who once were

dearest friends begin to persecute,

And more who once professed to love,

have silent grown and mute;

I tell Him all my grief,

He quickly sends relief,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.

4. And thus, by frequent little talks,

I gain the victory;

And march along with cheerful song,

enjoying liberty;

With Jesus as my Friend,

I'll prove until the end,

A little talk with Jesus makes

it right, all right.
