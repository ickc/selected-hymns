1.  Bless’d are the pure in heart,

For they shall see our God;

The secret of the Lord is theirs,

Their heart is Christ’s abode.

2.  The Lord, who left the heavens,\
Our life and peace to bring,\
To dwell in lowliness with men,\
Their pattern and their King:

3.  He to the lowly soul

Doth still Himself impart,

And for His dwelling and His throne

Chooseth the pure in heart.

4.  Lord, we Thy presence seek;

May ours this blessing be;

Give us a pure and lowly heart,

A temple meet for Thee.
