1.  The way of the Cross means sacrifice,

As to God you yield your all

To be laid on the altar, the place of death,

Where fire will surely fall.

’Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?

What does bearing the Cross mean to you?

You who’ve given yourself, your all to God!

To God are you wholly true?

2.  As the voice of song and prayer we raise,

How easy to say, We give all;\
Till some rougher cross lies just before,\
And sterner is duty’s call.

3.  Do you falter then, or, true to death,

Just die on the cross in the way,

Till the fulness of life from the Living One

Is filling you day by day?

4.  ’Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,\
One with Jesus crucified;\
With the life alone to be lived through you,\
Of the Risen, the Glorified.
