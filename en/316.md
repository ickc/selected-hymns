# 316 7.6.7.6.7.6.12. with chorus

1.  Wonderful grace of Jesus,

Greater than all my sin;

How shall my tongue describe it,

Where shall its praise begin?

Taking away my burden,

Setting my spirit free;

For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,

Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;

Higher than the mountain,

sparkling like a fountain,

All sufficient grace for even me,

Broader than the scope of my transgressions,

Greater far than all my sin and shame.

O magnify the precious name of Jesus,

Praise His name!

2.  Wonderful grace of Jesus,

Reaching to all the lost,

By it I have been pardoned,

Saved to the uttermost,

Chains have been torn asunder,

Giving me liberty;

For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.
