# 648 8.8.8.8.D.

1.  Some day the silver cord will break,

And I no more as now shall sing;

But, O the joy when I shall wake

Within the presence of the King!

And I shall see Him face to face,

And tell the story, saved by grace:

And I shall see Him face to face,

And tell the story, saved by grace.

2.  Some day my earthly house will fall,

I cannot tell how soon ‘twill be,

But this I know—my All in all

Has now a place with Him for me.

3.  Or some day when my Lord will come,

And called to meet Him I’ll be blest,

He then will say to me, “Well done,”

And I shall enter into rest.

4.  Some day, till then I’ll watch and wait,

My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,

That when my Savior I will greet,

My faith will then be changed to sight.
