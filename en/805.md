Lord, here I take my cross now to follow Thee,

Worldly gain, empty fame are but dross to me.

Men may sneer, men may jeer, pain may come or stay;

Naught can cause me to stray from the narrow way.

Thro’ His word, by His grace, I would faithful be;

Till at last I reach home, there’s a crown for me,

A bright crown for me, yes, a crown for me.
