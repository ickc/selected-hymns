# 222 8.8.8.8.

1.  On Christ, salvation rests secure;

The Rock of Ages must endure;

Nor can that faith be overthrown

Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”

2.  No other hope shall intervene;

To Him we look, on Him we lean;

Other foundations we disown,

And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”

3.  In Him it is ordained to raise

A temple to Jehovah’s praise,

Composed of all His saints, who own

No Savior but the “Living Stone.”

4.  View the vast building, see it rise:

The work how great! the plan how wise!

O wondrous fabric! pow’r unknown:

That rests it on the “Living Stone.”

5.  But most adore His precious name:

His glory and His grace proclaim!

For us, the lost, condemned, undone,

He gave Himself, the “Living Stone.”
