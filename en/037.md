1.  O God our Father, we would come to Thee

In virtue of our Savior’s precious blood;

All distance gone, our souls by grace set free,

We worship Thee, our Father and our God.

2.  We would, O God, present before Thy face

The fragrant name of Thy beloved Son;

By faith we view Him through Thy boundless grace,

Which, by His dying, He for us has won.

3.  Thy joy in Him who is with Thee we share;

Our hearts delight in Thy delight in Him;

Chiefest of thousands, fairer than the fair;

His glory nought can tarnish, nought can dim.

4.  We bow in worship now before Thy throne,

By faith the Object of Thy love would see;

Who, in the midst, His brethren’s song doth lead.

To Him, our Savior, shall the glory be!
