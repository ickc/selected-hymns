# 387 7.7.7.7. with chorus

1.  Savior, lead me, lest I stray,

Gently lead me all the way;

I am safe when by Thy side,

I would in Thy love abide.

Lead me, lead me,

Savior, lead me, lest I stray;

Gently down the stream of time,

Lead me, Savior, all the way.

2.  Thou the refuge of my soul,

When lifeâ€™s stormy billows roll,

I am safe when Thou art nigh,

All my hopes on Thee rely.

3.  Savior, lead me, then at last,

When the storm of life is past,

To the land of endless day,

Where all tears are wiped away.
