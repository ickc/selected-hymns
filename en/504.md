1.  Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine,

My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine,

Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,

I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.

2.  Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know

How love of Thine so vast in me may flow,

My empty vessel, running o’er with joy,

Must overflow to Thee without alloy.

3.  Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,

Can e’er prevail with Thy blest life within;

Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul

Knows naught besides its motions to control.

4.  Abide in Thee! ’tis thus I only know

The secrets of Thy mind e’en while below—

All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,

All pow’r and fruit, and service for the Lord.
