1.  I am the Lord’s! O joy beyond expression,

O sweet response to voice of love Divine;

Faith’s joyous “Yes” to the assuring whisper,

“Fear not! I have redeem’d thee; thou art Mine.”

2.  I am the Lord’s! It is the glad confession

Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,

When love’s “I will” accepted Him forever,

“The Lord’s,” to love, to honor and obey.

3.  I am the Lord’s! Yet teach me all it meaneth,

All it involves of love and loyalty,

Of holy service, absolute surrender,

And unreserved obedience unto Thee.

4.  I am the Lord’s! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,

O seal them irrecoverably Thine;

As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fullness

Forever and forevermore art mine.
