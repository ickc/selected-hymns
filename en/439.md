# 439 10.10.10.10. with chorus Thomas O. Chisholm

1.  Living for Jesus a life that is true,\
Striving to please Him in all that I do;\
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,\
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

O Jesus, Lord and Savior,

I give myself to Thee,

For Thou, in Thy atonement,

Didst give Thyself for me;

I own no other Master,

My heart shall be Thy throne,

My life I give, henceforth to live,

O Christ, for Thee alone.

2.  Living for Jesus who died in my place,

Bearing on Calv’ry my sin and disgrace;

Such love constrains me to answer His call,

Follow His leading and give Him my all.

3.  Living for Jesus wherever I am,

Doing each duty in His holy name;

Willing to suffer affliction and loss,

Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

4.  Living for Jesus through earth’s little while,

My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;

Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,

Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
