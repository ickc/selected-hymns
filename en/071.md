1.  Hark! the herald angels sing,

“Glory to the new-born King;

Peace on earth, and mercy mild;

God and sinners reconciled.”

Joyful, all ye nations, rise,

Join the triumph of the skies;

With angelic hosts proclaim,

“Christ is born in Bethlehem.”

(Repeat the last two lines)

2.  Christ, by highest heav’n adored,

Christ, the everlasting Lord:

Late in time behold Him come,

Offspring of a virgin’s womb.

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,

Hail th’incarnate Deity!

Pleased as man with man to dwell,

Jesus our Emmanuel.

3.  Hail the heav’n-born Prince of Peace!

Hail the Sun of righteousness!

Light and life to all He brings,

Ris’n with healing in His wings:

Mild He lays His glory by,

Born that man no more may die;

Born to raise the sons of earth;

Born to give them second birth.

4.  Come, Desire of nations, come!

Fix in us Thy humble home:

Rise, the woman’s conjuring seed,

Bruise in us the serpent’s head;

Adam’s likeness now efface,

Stamp Thine image in its place:

Final Adam from above,

Reinstate us in Thy love.
