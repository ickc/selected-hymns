# 697 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Have you any room for Jesus,

He who bore your load of sin?

As He knocks and asks admission,

Sinner, will you let Him in?

Room for Jesus, King of glory!

Hasten now, His word obey;

Swing the heartâ€™s door widely open,

Bid Him enter while you may.

2.  Room for pleasure, room for business,

But for Christ the Crucified,

Not a place that He can enter,

In the heart for which He died?

3.  Have you any room for Jesus,

As in grace He calls again?

O, today is time accepted,

Tomorrow you may call in vain.
