1.  God was born a human being

As the Babe of Bethlehem,

Passed He then through human living,

Perfect blend of God with men.

God, according to His plan,

Lived a mingled life with man.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen!

2.  Then with God this man was blended

On the altar as He died;

God and man and all creation

On the cross were crucified.

Man and all of God’s creation,

Sunk in total termination.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen!

3.  Everything we are was ended.

Terminated on the cross,

Only man in God ascended,

Man in Adam suffered loss.

Hallelujah, we’re elated,

Our old man was terminated.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen!

4.  Like the grain of wheat that’s buried

In the earth to be increased,

God’s own life the death must suffer,

Thus in man to be released.

Oh, the Lord of all be praised;

God released in man is raised!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Amen!
