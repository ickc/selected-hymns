1.  Teach me Thy way, O Lord, Teach me Thy way;

Thy gracious aid afford, Teach me Thy way.

Help me to walk aright; More by faith, less by sight;

Lead me with heav’nly light, Teach me Thy way.

2.  When doubts and fears arise, Teach me Thy way;

When storms o’erspread the skies, Teach me Thy way.

Shine thro’ the cloud and rain, Thro’ sorrow, toil, and pain;

Make Thou my pathway plain, Teach me Thy way.

3.  Long as my life shall last, Teach me Thy way;

Where’er my lot be cast, Teach me Thy way.

Until the race is run, Until the journey’s done,

Until the crown is won, Teach me Thy way.
