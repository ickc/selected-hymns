# 590 9.7.9.7. with chorus

1.  The cross that He gave may be heavy,

But it ne’er outweighs His grace;\
The storm that I feared may surround me,\
But it ne’er excludes His face.

The cross is not greater than His grace,\
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;\
I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below,\
I can conquer every foe.

2.  The thorns in my path are not sharper

Than composed His crown for me;\
The cup that I drink not more bitter\
Than He drank in Gethsemane.

3.  The light of His love shineth brighter,

As it falls on paths of woe;

The toil of my work groweth lighter,

As I stoop to raise the low.

4.  His will I have joy in fulfilling,

As I’m walking in His sight;

My trials more blessings are bringing,

Christ in them is my delight.
