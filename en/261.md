# 261 7.7.7.6.

1.  For the bread and for the wine,

For the pledge that seals Him mine,

For the words of love divine,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

2.  Only bread and only wine,

Yet to faith, the solemn sign

Of the heav’nly and divine!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

3.  For the words that turn our eye

To the cross of Calvary,

Bidding us in faith draw nigh,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

4.  For the words that fragrance breathe

These plain symbols underneath,

Words that His own peace bequeath,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

5.  For Thy words in Spirit shown,

For Thy will to us made known.

“Do ye this until I come,”

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

6.  Till He come we take the bread,

Type of Him on whom we feed,

Him who liveth and was dead!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

7.  Till He come we take the cup;

As we at His table sup,

Eye and heart are lifted up!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

8.  For that coming, here foreshown,

For that day to man unknown,

For the glory and the throne,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
