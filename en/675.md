1.  Free from the law—oh, happy condition!

Jesus hath bled, and there is remission;

Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,

Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

Once for all—oh, sinner, receive it;

Once for all—oh, doubter, believe it;

Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,

Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

2.  There on the cross your burden upbearing,

Thorns on His brow your Savior is wearing;

Never again your sin need appall,

You have been pardoned once for all.

3.  Now we are free—there’s no condemnation;

Jesus provides a perfect salvation:

“Come unto Me,” oh, hear His sweet call,

Come, and He saves us once for all.

4.  Children of man—oh, glorious calling,

Surely His grace will keep us from falling;

Passing from death to life at His call,

Blessed salvation once for all.
