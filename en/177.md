# 177 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  Praise waiteth Thee in Zion’s Courts,

Where Thy beloved dwell;

Ransomed, redeemed from Satan’s thrall,

Their Hallelujahs swell.

Come, blessed Holy Ghost, today,

Our songs of praise inspire;

Purge the iniquity, and touch

Our lips with living fire.

2.  Praise for what Thou our God hast wrought;

For promised blessings ours;

The cloud on faith’s horizon seen,

The pentecostal showers.

Praise for Thine own right way, dear Lord,

We did not understand,

But as Thy plans unfolded lie,

We see Thy guiding hand.

3.  Enlarge our soul’s capacity,

Cut deeper channels, Lord;

Room for the floods of blessing now,

According to Thy Word.

E’en while we praise, the heavens rend,

In power come from on high;

Make this another Pentecost,

Answer our spirit’s cry.
