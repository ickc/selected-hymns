With all the saints I’ll follow Him,

O praise the Lord!

2.  When I shall see Him face to face,

And dwell with Him thru endless days,

I will rejoice and sing His grace,

O praise the Lord!

O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!

O praise the Lord!

My suff’rings then will all be gone,

The joy of vict’ry will be won,

That nothing with Christ’s life can vie,

What glorious rapture to the sky,

Be always one and ne’er divide,

That His heart may be satisfied,

O praise the Lord!

O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!

That His heart may be satisfied,

O praise the Lord!

Receive us by Thy promised word,

And give the victors Thy reward,
