# 689 10.10.10.6. with chorus

1.  Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!

From condemnation He hath made me free;

“He that believeth on the Son” saith He,

“Hath everlasting life.”

“Verily, verily, I say unto you;”

“Verily, verily,” message ever new!

“He that believeth on the Son”—’tis true—

“Hath everlasting life?”

2.  All my iniquities on Him were laid,

All my indebtedness by Him was paid;

All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,

“Hath everlasting life.”

3.  Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;

Though weak and sinful, I believe His word;

Oh, glad message; every child of God

“Hath everlasting life.”

4.  Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;

For him that cometh He will not cast out:

“He that believeth”—oh, the good news shout!

“Hath everlasting life.”
