1.  Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;

My heart by mighty grace compelled

Surrenders all to Thee;

Against Thy terrors long I strove,

But who can stand against Thy love?

Love conquers even me.

2.  If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,

And light’nings flash, to blast my soul,

I still had stubborn been;

But mercy has my heart subdued,

A bleeding Savior I have viewed,

And now I hate my sin.

3.  Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,

Come, take possession of Thine own,

For Thou hast set me free;

Released from Satan’s hard command,

See all my powers waiting stand,

To be employed by Thee.
