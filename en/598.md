# 598 8.8.8.8. (A)

1.  How good is the God we adore,

Our faithful, unchangeable Friend;

Whose love is as great as His pow’r,

And knows neither measure nor end.

2.  ’Tis Jesus the First and the Last,

Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home:

We’ll praise Him for all that is past,

And trust Him for all that’s to come.
