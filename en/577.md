# 577 8.8.8.8.D.

1.  Not now, but in the coming years,

It may be when with Christ we stand,

We’ll read the meaning of our tears,

And there, sometime, we’ll understand.

Then trust in God through all thy days;

Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;

Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,

Sometime, sometime, we’ll understand.

2.  We’ll catch the broken thread again,

And finish what we here began;

God will the mysteries explain,

And then, ah, then, we’ll understand.

3.  We’ll know why clouds instead of sun

Were over many a cherished plan;

Why song has ceased when scarce begun;

’Tis then, sometime, we’ll understand.

4.  Why what we long for most of all,

Eludes so oft our eager hand;

Why hopes are crushed and castles fall,

Till then, sometime, we’ll understand.

5.  God knows the way, He holds the key,

He guides us with unerring hand;

Sometime with tearless eyes we’ll see;

Yes, then, ’tis then, we’ll understand.
