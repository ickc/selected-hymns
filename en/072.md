1.  Praise the Lord, God sent His Son,

Hallelujah!

And salvation’s work was done,

Glory to God!

God Himself became a man,

So that we might live in Him.

That’s why I call on Him,

I give my all to Him.

2.  For us He was crucified,

Hallelujah!

For the many, one Man died,

Glory to God!

One grain fell into the earth,

Many grains to bring to birth.

3.  He arose in victory,

Hallelujah!

From the grave, triumphantly,

Glory to God!

Now in resurrection He

As the Spirit lives in me.

4.  Call on Him from deep within,

Hallelujah!

Just by calling, He comes in,

Glory to God!

Once you call upon His name,

Nevermore you’ll be the same.

We all must call on Him,

We give our all to Him.
