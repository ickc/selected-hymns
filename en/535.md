# 535 8.6.8.8.6.

1.  Eternal Light! Eternal Light!\
How pure the soul must be\
When, placed within Thy searching sight,\
It shrinks not, but with calm delight\
Can live and look on Thee.

2.  The spirits that surround Thy throne

May bear the burning bliss;

But that is surely theirs alone,

Since they have never, never known

A fallen world like this.

3.  Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere

Is dark, whose mind is dim,

Before th’Ineffable appear,

And on my natural spirit bear

The uncreated beam?

4.  There is a way for man to rise

To Thee, sublime Abode;

An Offering and a Sacrifice,

A Holy Spirit’s energies,

An Advocate with God:

5.  These, these prepare us for the sight\
Of holiness above;\
The sons of ignorance and night\
May dwell in the eternal Light,\
Through the eternal Love.
