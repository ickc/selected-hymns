1.  Rise up, O men of God!

Have done with lesser things;

Give heart and soul and mind and strength

To serve the King of kings.

2.  Rise up, O men of God!\
His kingdom tarries long;\
Bring in the day of brotherhood\
And end the night of wrong.

3.  Rise up, O men of God!

The Church for you doth wait,

Her strength unequal to her task:

Rise up, and make her great.

4.  Lift high the cross of Christ,

Tread where His feet have trod;

As brothers of the Son of man,

Rise up, O men of God!
