# 209 10.9.10.9. with chorus

1.  I must tell Jesus all of my trials;

I cannot bear these burdens alone;

In my distress He kindly will help me;

He ever loves and cares for His own.

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

I cannot bear my burden alone;

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

2.  I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;

He is a kind, compassionate Friend;

If I but ask Him, He will deliver,

And in my griefs with me He will blend.

3.  Tempted and tried I need a great Savior,

One who can help my burdens to bear;

I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;

He all my cares and sorrows will share.

4.  O how the world to evil allures me!

O how my heart is tempted to sin!

I must tell Jesus; He will enable

Over the world the victâ€™ry to win.
