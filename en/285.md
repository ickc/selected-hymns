# 285 10. 10. 9. 6. with chorus

1.  Jesus my Lord will love me forever,

From Him no pow’r of evil can sever,

He gave His life to ransom my soul,

Now I belong to Him.

Now I be long to Jesus,

Jesus be longs to me,

Not for the years of time alone,

But for eternity

2.  Once I was lost in sin’s degradation,

Jesus came down to bring me salvation,

Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,

Now I belong to Him.

3.  Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me,

Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me,

His precious blood He gave to redeem,

Now I belong to Him.
