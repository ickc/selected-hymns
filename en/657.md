# 657 10.10.10.10. with chorus

1.  Sing we the King who is coming to reign,

Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain;

Righteousness, peace then His empire shall bring,

Joy to the nations when Jesus is King.

Come let us sing: Praise to our King,

Jesus our King, Jesus our King:

This is our song, who to Jesus belong:

Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

2.  All men shall dwell in His marvelous light,

Races long severed His love shall unite,

Justice and truth from His scepter shall spring,

Wrong shall be ended when Jesus is King.

3.  All shall be well in His kingdom of peace,

Freedom shall flourish and wisdom increase,

Foe shall be friend when His triumph we sing,

Sword shall be sickle when Jesus is King.

4.  Knowledge and fear of the Lord then shall be

As the deep waters that cover the sea;

All things shall be in the splendor of spring

And all harmonious when Jesus is King.

5.  Kingdom of Christ, for thy coming we pray,

Hasten, O Father, the dawn of the day

When this new song Thy creation shall sing,

Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King.
