# 502 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Savior, I by faith am touching

Thee, the source of every good;

Virtue now, by faith am claiming,

Through the cleansing of Thy blood.

Touching Thee, new life is glowing

By Thy Spirit’s burning flame;

Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,

Glory to Thy Holy Name!

2.  Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee

In Thy riches full and free;

All I am I open to Thee,

All Thou art Thou giv’st to me.

3.  Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,

O most mighty King of kings;

Of Thy fulness now receiving,

High I mount on eagle wings.

4.  Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom,

All my need, by Thee supplied;

Keep me touching, keep me claiming,

Keep me ever at Thy side.
