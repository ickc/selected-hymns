# 361 8.6.8.6.

1.  As pants the hart for cooling streams

When heated in the chase,

So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,

And Thy refreshing grace.

2.  Why restless, why cast down, my soul?

Trust God, who will employ

His aid for thee, and change these sighs

To thankful hymns of joy.

3.  For Thee, my God, the living God,

My thirsty soul doth pine;

Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,

Thou Majesty Divine?

4.  God of my strength, how long shall I,

Like one forgotten, mourn,

Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed

To my oppressor’s scorn?

5.  Why restless, why cast down, my soul?

Hope still, and thou shalt sing

The praise of Him who is thy God,

Thy health’s eternal spring.
