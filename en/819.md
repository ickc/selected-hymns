# 819 7.5.7.5. with chorus

1.  When I fear my faith will fail,

Christ will hold me fast;

When the tempter would prevail,

He can hold me fast.

He will hold me fast,

He will hold me fast;

For my Savior loves me so,

He will hold me fast.

2.  I could never keep my hold,

He will hold me fast;

For my love is often cold,

He must hold me fast.

3.  I am precious in His sight,

He will hold me fast;

Those He saves are His delight,

He will hold me fast.

4.  He'll not let my soul be lost,

Christ will hold me fast;

Bought by Him at such a cost,

He will hold me fast:
