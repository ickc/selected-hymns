# 622 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  ’Tis easy when the morning

Appears at last to view

To praise thy strong Redeemer

Who burst the bondage through,

But ’tis the praise at midnight

That gives the foe alarm,

That glorifies thy Savior,

And bares His strong right arm.

2.  If thou wouldst be a conqueror,

Yea, more than conqueror thou,

If thou wilt shout in triumph

And claim the victory now;

The prison-doors will open,

The dungeon gleam with light,

And sin-chained souls around thee

Shall see thy Lord’s great might.
