# 326 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  All my life long I had panted

For a draught from some cool spring,

That I hoped would quench the burning

Of the thirst I felt within.

Hallelujah! I have found Him

Whom my soul so long has craved!

Jesus satisfies my longings;

Thro’ His life I now am saved.

2.  Feeding on the husks around me,

Till my strength was almost gone,

Longed my soul for something better,

Only still to hunger on.

3.  Poor I was, and sought for riches,

Something that would satisfy,

But the dust I gathered round me

Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.

4.  Well of water, ever springing,

Bread of life, so rich and free,

Untold wealth that never faileth,

My Redeemer is to me.
