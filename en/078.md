# 078 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  O Head once full of bruises,

So full of pain and scorn!

Mid other sore abuses,

Mocked with a crown of thorn:

O Head e’en now surronded

With brightest majesty,

In death once bowed and wounded

On the accursed tree:

2.  Thou Countenance transcendent!

Thou life-creating Sun!

To worlds on Thee dependent

Yet bruised and spit upon:

O Lord, what Thee tormented

Was our sins’ heavy load,

We had the debt augmented

Which Thou didst pay in blood.

3.  We give Thee thanks unfeigned,

O Savior, Friend in need,

For what Thy soul sustained

When Thou for us didst bleed.

Grant us to lean unshaken

Upon Thy faithfulness,

Until, to glory taken,

We see Thee face to face.
