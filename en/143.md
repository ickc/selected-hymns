# 143 8.6.8.6. with repeat (Repeat the last line of each stanza)

1.  Majestic sweetness sits enthroned

Upon the Savior’s brow;

His head with radiant glories crowned,

His lips with grace o’erflow.

2.  No mortal can with Him compare

Among the sons of men;

Fairer is He than all the fair

That fill the heavenly train.

3.  He saw me plunged in deep distress,

He flew to my relief;

For me He bore the shameful cross

And carried all my grief.

4.  To God, the Father, my abode,

He brings my weary feet;

Shows me the glories of my God,

And makes my joys complete.

5.  Since from His bounty I receive

Such proofs of love divine,

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

Lord, they should all be Thine.
