1.  Fight the good fight with all thy might!

Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;

Lay hold on life, and it shall be

Thy joy and crown eternally.

2.  Run the straight race through Godâ€™s good grace,

Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;

Life with its way before us lies,

Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

3.  Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;

His boundless mercy will provide;

Trust, and thy trusting soul shah prove

Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

4.  Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,

He changeth not, and thou art dear;

Only believe, and thou shalt see

That Christ is all in all to thee.
