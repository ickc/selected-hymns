1.  Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee;

Stranger hands no more impede;

Pass thou on, His strength protects thee,

Strength that has the captive freed.

2.  Is the wilderness before thee,

Desert lands where drought abides?

Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,

Fresh from God’s exhaustless tides.

3.  Light divine surrounds thy going,

God Himself shall mark thy way;

Secret blessings, richly flowing,

Lead to everlasting day.

4.  God, thine everlasting portion,

Feeds thee with the Mighty’s meat;

Saved from Egypt’s hard extortion,

Egypt’s food no more to eat.

5.  Art thou weaned from Egypt’s pleasures?

God in secret shall thee keep;

There unfold His hidden treasures,

There His love’s exhaustless deep.

6.  In the desert God will teach thee

What the God that thou hast found—

Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;

All His grace shall there abound.

7.  On to Canaan’s rest still wending,

E’en thy wants and woes shall bring

Suited grace from high descending;

Thou shalt taste of mercy’s spring.

8.  Though thy way be long and dreary,

Eagle strength He’ll still renew;

Garments fresh, and feet unweary,

Tell how God hath brought thee through.

9.  When to Canaan’s long-loved dwelling

Love divine thy feet shall bring,

Thou, with shouts of triumph swelling,

Zion’s songs in rest shall sing.
