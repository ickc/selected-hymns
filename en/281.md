# 281 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!

He loved me ere I knew Him;

He drew me with the cords of love,

And thus He bound me to Him.

And round my heart still closely twine

Those ties which naught can sever,

For I am His, and He is mine,

Forever and forever.

2.  I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!

He bled, He died to save me;

And not alone the gift of life,

But His own self He gave me.

Naught that I have my own I call,

I hold it for the Giver;

My heart, my strength, my life, my all,

Are His, and His forever.

3.  I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!

So kind, and true, and tender,

So wise a Counsellor and Guide,

So mighty a Defender!

From Him who loves me now so well,

What power my soul can sever?

Shall life or death, or earth or hell?

No, I am His forever.
