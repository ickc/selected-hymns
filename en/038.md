1.  Our God and Father we respond anew

To love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy name.

He did Thy will; and for the joy in view,

Endured the cross, despising all the shame.

2.  He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise;

We hear His song, our hearts responsive swell;

And on this day when He His voice doth raise,

In spirit we do join and praise Thee well.

3.  Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son,

We have our part in joy before Thy face;

Predestined, ere this world had yet begun,

For that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace.

4.  Sons loved and loving, whom Thy spirit fills,

Our endless portion Christ in us to be;

Each with some trait of Him whose love us thrills,

For Thy delight and joy eternally.
