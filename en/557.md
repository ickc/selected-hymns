1.  Beneath the cross of Jesus

I fain would take my stand,

The shadow of a mighty Rock

Within a weary land;

A home within the wilderness,

A rest upon the way,

From the burning of the noontide heat,

And the burden of the day.

2.  Oh, safe and happy shelter!

Oh, refuge tried and sweet!

Oh, trysting place where heaven’s love

And heaven’s justice meet.

As to the holy patriarch

That wondrous dream was given,

So is my Savior by the cross

A ladder up to heaven.

3.  There lies beneath its shadow,

But on the farther side,

The darkness of an awful grave

That gapes both deep and wide;

And there between us stands the cross,

Two arms outstretched to save,

Like a watchman set to guard the way

From that eternal grave.

4.  Upon that cross of Jesus

Mine eye at times can see

The very dying form of One,

Who suffered there for me;

And from my smitten heart, with tears,

Two wonders I confess,

The wonders of His glorious love,

And my own worthlessness.

5.  I take, O cross, thy shadow

For my abiding place;

I ask no other sunshine than

The sunshine of His face;

Content’ to let the world go by,

To know no gain nor loss,

My sinful self my only shame,

My glory all the cross.
