# 401 11.11.11.11. with chorus

1.  Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,

I want Thee forever to live in my soul;

Break down ev’ry idol, cast out ev’ry foe;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;

Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

2.  Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,

Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;

To get this blest cleansing I all things forego;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

3.  Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,

And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

I give up myself and whatever I know;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

4.  Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;

By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

5.  Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;

Come now, and within me a new heart create;

To those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
