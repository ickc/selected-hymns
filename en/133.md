1.  Rejoice, the Lord is King,

Your Lord and Kind adore;

Mortals, give thanks and sing,

And triumph evermore:

Lift up your heart, lift up you voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

2.  His kingdom cannot fail;

He rules o’er earth and heav’n;

The keys of death and hell

Are to our Jesus giv’n:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

3.  Jesus, the Savior, reigns,

The God of truth and love:

When He had purged our stains,

He took His seat above:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

4.  He sits at God’s right hand

Till all His foes submit,

And bow to His command,

And fall beneath His feet:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;

Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.
