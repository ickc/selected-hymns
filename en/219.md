1.  Don’t you be in such a hurry,

‘Cause it only leads to worry,

There’s a time to work

but there’s a time to pray.

Try to find a quiet place

To hear His voice and seek His face.

Can you hear the Spirit calling

“come away”?

Come away, come away

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

Let your heart and mind be stilled,

Let you empty cup be filled.

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

2.  Are you sinking in your sorrow,

Are you worried about tomorrow,

Are the pressures of this life

too hard to bear?

If you cast your cares on Him,

He’ll give you perfect peace within.

Can you hear the Spirit calling

“come away”?

Come away, come away

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.

Come and spend some time with Me,

And My love will set you free.

Come and spend some time with Me,

Come away.
