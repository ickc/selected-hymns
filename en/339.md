# 339 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  I know not why God’s wondrous grace

To me He hath made known,

Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love

Redeemed me for His own.

But “I know Whom I have believed

And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed

Unto Him against that day.”

2.  I know not how this saving faith

To me He did impart,

Nor how believing in His word

Wrought peace within my heart.

3.  I know not how the Spirit moves,

Convincing men of sin,

Revealing Jesus through the Word,

Creating faith in Him.

4.  I know not what of good or ill

May be reserved for me,

Of weary ways or golden days,

Before His face I see.

5.  I know not when my Lord may come,

At night or noon-day fair,

Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,

Or “meet Him in the air.”
