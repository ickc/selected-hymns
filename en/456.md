1.  Nothing’s quite so precious

As Jesus in my spirit.

He takes away the care

And fills me with His peace.

He never leaves me,

E’en as the days grow weary.

His presence goes with me.

My soul delights to hide in His arms.

I call His name, “Lord Jesus, Help me in my weakness.”

So faithfully each day in me

He proves His life is so sufficient.

2.  Nothing’s quite so precious

As Jesus in my spirit.

He tums my heart to Him,

To feast upon His life.

It’s nothing I do—

His mercy’s just upon me.

And God’s free gift of grace

Becomes an endless joy to me.
