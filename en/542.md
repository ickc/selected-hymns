1.  The cross—we all were there,

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

For all that death did share!

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

God there upon it died,

And man and all beside

Were wholly crucified—

Hallelujah for the cross!

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

Hallelujah for the cross!

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

It shall never suffer loss!

2.  The cross, it holdeth fast,

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

All things upon it cast,

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

Two arms extended strong

Hold those who there belong;

We’re through with self—our song:

Hallelujah for the cross!

3.  ’Tis there man died in God,

Hallelujah! hallelujah!;

There ceased this human clod,

Hallelujah! hallelujah!

With joy we all declare,

We’re terminated there!

We’ll sing now and fore’er,

Hallelujah for the cross!

4.  ’Tis there man died in God,\
Hallelujah! hallelujah!\
Fulfilling thus His plan,\
Hallelujah! hallelujah!\
Through death He was released\
And now He has increased;\
His life is our rich feast—\
Hallelujah for the cross!

Hallelujah! hallelujah!\
God has been released in us!\
Hallelujah! hallelujah!\
Hallelujah for the cross!
