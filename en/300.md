# 300 9.8.9.8. with chorus

1.  Redeemedâ€”how I love to proclaim it!

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed through His infinite mercy,

His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed, redeemed,

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed, redeemed,

His child, and forever, I am.

2.  Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,\
No language my rapture can tell;\
I know that the light of His presence\
With me doth continually dwell.

3.  I think of my blessed Redeemer,

I think of Him all the day long;

I sing, for I cannot be silent;

His love is the theme of my song.

4.  I know I shall see in His beauty

The King in whose law I delight;

Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,

And giveth me songs in the night.
