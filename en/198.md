1.  Lord, hast Thou not one word for me

To bind my soul more close to Thee,

That ev’ry evil I may flee;

One word, O Lord! One word from Thee?

2.  One word, to show how weak am I

When in my strength alone I try,

In vain I toil, in vain I sigh;

One word, O Lord! One word from Thee.

3.  One word, to show how near Thou art,

For Thou dost dwell within my heart;

And of Thy life I share a part;

One word, O Lord! One word from Thee.

4.  One word of power, oh, let me hear,

Above the heart’s most anxious fear,

Thy still, small voice, yet deep and clear;

One word, O Lord! One word from Thee.

5.  One word of final triumph, Lord;

Sweet hope Thy promises afford,

To dwell with Thee in sweet accord;

One word, O Lord! One word from Thee.
