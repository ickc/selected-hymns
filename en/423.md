1.  Thy Life was giv’n for me,

Thy blood, O Lord, was shed,

That I might ransomed be,

And quickened from the dead;

Thy Life was giv’n for me, for me;

What have I giv’n for Thee?

2.  Long years were spent for me

In weariness and woe,

That through eternity

Thy glory I might know;

Long years were spent for me, for me;

Have I spent one for Thee?

3.  Thy Father’s home of light,

Thy rainbow-circled throne,

Were left for earthly night,

For wanderings sad and lone;

Yea, all was left for me, for me;

Have I left aught for Thee?

4.  Thou, Lord, hast borne for me

More than my tongue can tell

Of bitterest agony,

To rescue me from hell;

Thou suff’redst all for me, for me;

What have I borne for Thee?

5.  And Thou hast brought to me

Down from Thy home above

Salvation full and free,

Thy pardon and Thy love;

Great gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;

What have I brought to Thee?

6.  Oh, let my life be given,

My years for Thee be spent;

World-fetters all be riven,

And joy with suffr’ing blent;

Thou gav’st Thyself for me, for me,

I give myself to Thee.
