1.  King of my life, I crown Thee now,

Thine shall the glory be;

Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,

Lead me to Calvary.

Lest I forget Gethsemane;

Lest I forget Thine agony;

Lest I forget Thy love for me,

Lead me to Calvary.

2.  Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

Tenderly moumed and wept;

Angels in robes of light arrayed

Guarded Thee while Thou slept.

3.  Let me like Mary, through the gloom,

Come with a gift to Thee;

Show to me now the empty tomb,

Lead me to Calvary.

4.  May I be willing, Lord, to bear

Daily my cross for Thee;

Even Thy cup of grief to share,

Thou hast home all for me.

5.  Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire

For all that know not Thee;

Then touch my lips with holy fire.

To speak of Calvary.
