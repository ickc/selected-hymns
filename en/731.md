1.  Jesus and shall it ever be?

A mortal man ashamed of Thee?

Ashamed of Thee, Whom angels praise,

Whose glories shine thro’ endless days?

2.  Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far

Let night disown each radiant star:

’Tis midnight with my soul, till He.

Bright Morning Star’, bid darkness flee.

3.  Ashamed of Jesus! O as soon

Let morning blush to own the sun;

He sheds the beams of light divine,

O’er this benighted soul of mine.

4.  Ashamed of Jesus! that dear friend

On whom my glorious hope depends?

No, when blush, be this my shame,

That I no more revere His Name.

5.  Till then—nor is the boasting vain—

Till then, I boast a Savior slain;

And, O may this my glory be,

That Christ is not ashamed of me.
