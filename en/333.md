# 333 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,

By His presence all divine?

True and tender, pure and precious,

O how blest to call Him mine!

All that thrills my soul is Jesus,

He is more than life to me;

And the fairest of ten thousand,

In my blessed Lord I see.

2.  Love of Christ so freely given,

Grace of God beyond degree,

Mercy higher than the heaven,

Deeper than the deepest sea.

3.  What a wonderful redemption!

Never can a mortal know

How my sin, tho’ red like crimson,

Can be whiter than the snow.

4.  Ev’ry need His hand supplying,

Ev’ry good in Him I see;

On His strength divine relying,

He is all in all to me.

5.  By the crystal flowing river

With the ransomed I will sing,

And forever and forever

Praise and glorify the King.
