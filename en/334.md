# 334 10.10.10.10. with chorus

1.  I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold,

I’d rather be His than have riches

I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands,

I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

Than to be the king of a vast domain,

And be held in sin’s dread sway;

I’d rather have Jesus than anything,

This world affords today.

2.  I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause,

I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause;

I’d rather have Jesus than world wide fame,

I’d rather be true to His holy name.

3.  He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,

He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb;

He’s all that my hungering spirit needs,

I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
