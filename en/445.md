# 445 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Am I a soldier of the Cross—

A follower of the Lamb?

And shall I fear to own His cause,

Or blush to speak His name?

In the name, the precious name,

Of Him who died for me,

Through grace I’ll win the promised crown,

Whate’er my cross may be.

2.  Must I be carried to the skies

On flowery beds of ease,

While others fought to win the prize

And sailed through bloody seas?

3.  Are there no foes for me to face?

Must I not stem the flood?

Is this vile world a friend to grace,

To help me on to God?

4.  Since I must fight if I would reign,

Increase my courage, Lord!

I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,

Supported by Thy Word.
