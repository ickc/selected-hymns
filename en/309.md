1.  Once I was bound by sinâ€™s galling fetters,

Chained like a slave I struggled in vain;

But I received a glorious freedom,

When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.

Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,

No more in chains of sin I repine!

Jesus the glorious Emancipator,

Now and forever He shall be mine.

2.  Freedom from all the carnal affections,

Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;

Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions,

Freedom from all that saddened my life.

3.  Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,

Freedom from love and glitter of gold;

Freedom from evil temper and anger,

Glorious freedom, rapture untold.

4.  Freedom from fear with all of its torments,

Freedom from care with all of its pain;

Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,

He who has rent my fetters in twain.
