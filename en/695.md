# 695 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Come, every soul by sin oppressed,

There’s mercy with the Lord;

And He will surely give you rest

By trusting in His Word.

Only trust Him! Only trust Him!

Only trust Him now!

He will save you! He will save you!

He will save you now!

2.  For Jesus shed His precious blood

Rich blessings to bestow;

Plunge now into the crimson flood

That washeth white as snow.

3.  Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,

That leads you into rest;

Believe in Him without delay,

And you are fully blest.

4.  Come then, and join the holy band,

And on to glory go;

In Christ’s redemption take your stand,

And all His goodness know.
