1.  Join all the glorious names

Of wisdom, love, and pow’r,

That mortals ever knew,

That angels ever bore;:

All are too mean to speak His worth,

Too mean to set my Savior forth.

2.  Great Prophet of my God,

My tongue would bless Thy name;

By Thee the joyful news

Of our salvation came;

The joyful news of sins forgiv’n,

Of hell subdued, and peace with heaven.

3.  Jesus, my great High Priest,

Offered His blood, and died;

My guilty conscience seeks

No sacrifice beside

His pow’rful blood did once atone,

And now it pleads before the throne.

4.  I love my Shepherd’s voice:

His watchful eye shall keep

My wand’ring soul among

The thousands of His sheep:

He feeds His flock, He calls their names,

His bosom bears the tender lambs.

5.  My Savior and my Lord,

My conqu’ror and my King,

Thy scepter and Thy sword,

Thy reigning grace I sing:

Thine is the pow’r; behold I sit

In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.
