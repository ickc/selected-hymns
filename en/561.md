1.  Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,

My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;

Thou art enough how ever long the day,

Thou art enough however dark the night.

2.  Thou art my God—the All-Sufficient One,

Thou canst create for me whate’er I lack;

Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track

With miracles of love and tender care.

3.  For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare

Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast,

And there adore Thy ways in faith’s deep rest,

And there adore Thy ways in faith’s quiet rest.
