# 668 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  The Great Physician now is near,

The sympathizing Jesus;

He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,

Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!

Sweetest note in seraph song;

Sweetest name on mortal tongue;

Sweetest carol ever sung:

Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2.  Your many sins are all forgiv’n,

Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;

The veil ‘twixt you and God is riven,

Redemption wrought by Jesus.

3.  All glory to the dying Lamb!

I now believe in Jesus;

I love the blessed Savior’s name,

I love the name of Jesus.

4.  His name dispels my guilt and fear,

No other name but Jesus;

Oh, how my soul delights to hear

The precious name of Jesus!
