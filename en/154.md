1.  Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs

Now to Thee we raise.

Never could we fully utter

A Thy worth and praise!

Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!

Sweet eternal strain.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Praise the Lord! Amen

2.  Praise the Lamb! Yes, Thou art worthy,

Who didst shed Thy blood

To redeem Thy saints, and make us

Kings and priests to God!

3.  Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus,

Canst not cease to love;

Thine we are and Thine forever,

One with Thee above.

4.  Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah!

Who would hush the song?

Join with saints from every nation,

Every tribe and tongue.
