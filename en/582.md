# 582 8.6.8.6.

1.  Through all the changing scenes of life,

In trouble and in joy,

The praises of my God shall still\
My heart and tongue employ.

2.  Oh, magnify the Lord with me,\
With me exalt His name;\
When in distress to Him I called,\
He to my rescue came.

3.  The hosts of God encamp around\
The dwellings of the just;\
Deliverance He affords to all\
Who on His succor trust.

4.  Oh, make but trial of His love,

Experience will decide

How blest they are, and only they,

Who in His truth confide.

5.  Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then

Have nothing else to fear;

Make you His service your delight,

Your wants shall be His care.
