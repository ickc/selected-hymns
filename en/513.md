1.  Simply trusting every day;

Trusting through a stormy way;

Even when my faith is small,

Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting as the moments fly,

Trusting as the days go by,

Trusting Him, whateâ€™er befall,

Trusting Jesus, that is all.

2.  Brightly doth His Spirit shine

Into this poor heart of mine;

While He leads I cannot fall,

Trusting Jesus, that is all.

3.  Singing if my way be clear,

Praying if the path be drear;

If in danger, for Him call,

Trusting Jesus, that is all.

4.  Trusting Him while life shall last,

Trusting Him till earth is past,

Till His gracious advent call,

Trusting Jesus, that is all.
