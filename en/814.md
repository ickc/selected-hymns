1.  Oh, how the thought of God attracts

And draws the heart from earth,

And sickens it of passing shows

And dissipating mirth!

2.  'Tis not enough to save our souls,

To shun th' eternal fires;

The thought of God will rouse the heart

To more sublime desires.

3.  God only is the creature's home,

Though rough and straight the road;

Yet nothing less can satisfy

The love that longs for God.

4.  Oh, utter but the Name of God

Down in your heart of hearts,

And see how from the world at once

All tempting light departs.

5.  A trusting heart, a yearning eye,

Can win their way above;

If mountains can be moved by faith,

Is there less power in love?

6.  How little of that road, my soul!

How little hast thou gone!

Take heart, and let the thought of God

Allure thee further on.

7.  The freedom from all willful sin,

The Christian's daily task;

Oh! these are graces far below

What longing love would ask!

8.  The perfect way is hard to flesh;

It is not hard to love;

If thou wert sick for want of God,

How swiftly wouldst thou move!

9.  Then keep thy conscience sensitive;

No inward token miss:

And go where grace entices theeâ€”

Perfection lies in this.
