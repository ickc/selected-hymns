# 354 11.11.11.11.

1.  Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;

For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;

My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou,

If ever I lov’d Thee, Lord Jesus, ‘tis now.

2.  I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,

And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree;

I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;

If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

3.  I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,

And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;

And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,

If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

4.  In ages eternal of endless delight

I’ll ever adore Thee in glory so bright;

I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,

If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.
