# 254 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  We’re gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:

Though we be many, yet we all are one.

We share Thy life and own that we are members,

And thus within, in life we all are one.

There is one Body in this universe,

And we express it here on earth;

We stand as one in each locality

For all to see, for all to see.

2.  There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:

‘Twas broken so that all the saints may share:

We eat this bread and, as we are partaking,

Our actual oness with all saints declare.

3.  One bread, one cup are now upon the table,

Showing that we can be naught else but one.

Christ has redeemed us, made us His own Body:

What can we say but, “Amen, Lord, we’re one!”

4.  We stand as one, and cannot be divided,

Because our oneness is of Christ alone.

We eat as one: one loaf, one cup partaking,

And thus our oneness visibly is shown.

5.  Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!

We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;

And we too share this blissful satisfaction

Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.
