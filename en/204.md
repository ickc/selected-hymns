# 204 8.6.8.6.

1.  Jesus is longing for His Bride,

All glorious within.

His longing ill be satisfied

When she is fit for Him.

2.  â€™Tis by the Word the church is made

Holy and pure as He;

All spots and wrinkles it removes

That she His Bride may be.

3.  We must redeem these golden days,

Receive the Word in prayer,

Amening every line and phrase,

And thus for Him prepare.

4.  Oh, how the Word doth penetrate,

Spirit and soul divide,

Revealing every hidden weight

For us to lay aside.

5.  Lord, how we thank Thee for Thy Word

Living and operative.

Oh, for Thy coming, we are stirred

Ever by it to live!

6.  Lord, make us those who bring Thee back,

Who satisfy Thy heart.

Now by Thy Word supply our lack,

Make us Thy counterpart.
