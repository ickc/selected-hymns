# 051 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  All praise to Him who reigns on high,

In majesty supreme,

Who gave His life for man to die,

That He might man redeem.

Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name,

Blessed be the name of the Lord;

Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name,

Blessed be the name of the Lord.

2.  His name above all names shall stand,

Exalted more and more,

At God the Father’s own right hand,

Where angel hosts adore.

3.  Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man

Once ruined by the fall,

Thou hast devised salvation’s plan,

For Thou hast died for all.

4.  His name shall be the counsellor,

The mighty Prince of Peace,

Of all earth’s Kingdoms, conqueror,

Whose reign shall never cease.
