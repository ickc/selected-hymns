1.  Glory to Christ on high!

Let praises fill the sky!

Praise ye His name:

He all our sorrows bore;

Angels His name adore,

And saints cry evermore,

“Worthy the Lamb!”

2.  All they around the throne

Cheerfully join in one,

Praising His name:

We who have known His blood

Sealing our peace with God,

Spread His dear name abroad;

Worthy the Lamb!

3.  Join all the human race

Our Lord, God’s Christ, to bless,

Praise ye His name:

In Him we will rejoice,

Making a cheerful noise,

Saying with heart and voice,

“Worthy the Lamb!”

4.  Though we must change our place,

Our hearts shall never cease

Praising His name:

To Him we’ll tribute bring,

Laud Him, our gracious King,

And, without ceasing, sing,

“Worthy the Lamb!”
