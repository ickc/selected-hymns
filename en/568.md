1.  Hark! a voice from heav’n proclaiming,\
“It is done.”\

“It is done.”

Hear the message from the throne,

Claim the promise, doubting one;

God hath spoken, “It is done.”

Faith has answered, “It is done.”

Prayer is over, praise begun.

Hallelujah, “It is done.”

“It is done.”

Claim His finished work, replying,

“It is done.”

3.  Yield thyself in consecration,

“It is done.”

Take the Lord for full salvation,

“It is done.”

4.  Claim the promise of His healing,

“It is done.”

Trust without a sign or feeling,

“It is done.”

5.  Say of every promised blessing,

“It is done.”

Rest upon His word, confessing,

“It is done.”

6.  This the secret of receiving,

“It is done.”

Take Him at His word believing,

“It is done.”
