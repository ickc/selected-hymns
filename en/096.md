1.  Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!

Hail, Thou still rejected King!

Thou didst suffer to release us,

Thou didst free salvation bring;

Thro’ Thy death and resurrection,

Bearer of our sin and shame!

We enjoy divine protection,

Life and glory thro’ Thy name.

2.  Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,

All our sins on Thee were laid;

By our Father’s love anointed,

Thou redemption’s price hast paid

All who trust Thee are forgiven

Thro’ the virtue of Thy blood;

Opened is the gate of heaven,

Grace shines forth to man from God.

3.  Savior, hail! enthroned in glory,

Where for us Thou dost abide:

We, by faith, do now adore Thee,

Seated at Thy Father’s side.

There, for us Thou now art pleading,”

There Thou dost our sorrows share.

Ever for us interceding,

Till in glory we appear.

4.  Worship, honor, praise, and blessing,

Thou art worthy to receive;

Loudest praises, without ceasing,

Meet it is for us to give.

In that day Thy saints will meet Thee,

Welcome Thee with grateful song;

Joyful hearts will ever greet Thee,

Source of joy to all the throng!
