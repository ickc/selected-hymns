# 550 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  If the path I travel

Lead me to the cross,

If the way Thou choosest

Lead to pain and loss,

Let the compensation

Daily, hourly, be

Shadowless communion,

Blessed Lord, with Thee.

2.  If there’s less of earth joy,

Give, Lord, more of heaven.

Let the spirit praise Thee,

Though the heart be riven;

If sweet earthly ties, Lord,

Break at Thy decree,

Let the tie that binds us,

Closer, sweeter, be.

3.  Lonely though the pathway,

Cheer it With Thy smile;

Be Thou my companion

Through earth’s little while;

Selfless may I live, Lord,

By Thy grace to be

Just a cleansed channel

For Thy life through me.
