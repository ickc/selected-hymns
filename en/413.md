# 413 7.7.7.5.

1.  Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,

Taught by You, we covet most,

Of Your gifts at Pentecost,

Holy heavenly love.

2.  Faith that mountains could remove,

Tongues of earth or heaven above,

Knowledge, all things, empty prove

Without heavenly love.

3.  Love is kind, and suffers long,

Love is meek, and thinks no wrong,

Love than death itself more strong:

Therefore give us love.

4.  Though I as a martyr bleed,

Give my goods the poor to feed,

All is vain if love I need;

Therefore give me love.

5.  Prophecy will fade away

Melting in the light of day;

Love will ever with us stay:

Therefore give us love.

6.  Faith, and hope, and love we see

Joining hand in hand, agree;

But the greatest of the three,

And the best, is love.
