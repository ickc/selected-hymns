# 365 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Love Divine, all love excelling,

Joy of heav’n, to earth come down;

Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,

All Thy faithful mercies crown.

Jesus, Thou art all compassion;

Pure, unbounded love Thou art;

Visit us with Thy salvation,

Enter every trembling heart.

2.  Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit

Into every troubled breast;

Let us all in Thee inherit,

Let us find the promised rest.

Take away the love of sinning;

Alpha and Omega be;

End of faith, as its beginning,

Set our hearts at liberty.

3.  Come, Almighty, to deliver,

Let us all Thy life receive;

May Thy presence e’er be with us,

Never more Thy temples leave.

Thee we would be always blessing,

Serve Thee as Thou wouldst approve,

Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,

Glory in Thy perfect love.

4.  Finish, then, Thy new creation;

Pure and spotless let us be;

Let us see Thy great salvation

Perfectly restored in Thee;

Changed from glory into glory

Till with Thee we take our place,

Till we cast our crowns before Thee,

Lost in wonder, love and praise.
