1.  O Lord, Thy boundless love to me

No thought can reach, no tongue declare;

Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,

And reign without a rival there;

Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;

Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.

2.  Oh, grant that nothing in my soul

May dwell but Thy pure love alone;

Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,

My joy, my treasure, and my crown;

All coldness from my heart remove;

May every act, word, thought, be love.

3.  O Love, how cheering is Thy ray,

All pain before Thy presence flies;

Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,

Whereâ€™er Thy healing beams arise;

Lord Jesus, nothing may I see,

And naught desire, or seek, but Thee.
