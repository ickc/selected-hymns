1.  What a happy day

When I no more could turn away,

When Jesus took my heart

from the black of night

Into the kingdom of His light.

2.  Now my life’s begun,

The “really life” that’s in the Son.

No more am I enthralled by

earth’s empty dreams;

Deep in me flows a living stream.

3.  As I turn to Him

He fills me with His life within.

His life becomes my life in reality;

Oh, hallelujah, He’s in me!

4.  I just love You, Lord,

With other loves, You break the cord.

You’ll be my life for all eternity;

You are the only One for me.
