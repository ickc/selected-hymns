1.  Come let us anew

Our journey pursue,

Roll round with the year,

And never stand still till the Master appear.

His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,

And our talents improve,

By the patience of hope, and the labor of love,

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  Our life is a dream,

Our time as a stream

Glides swiftly away,

And the fugitive moment refuses to stay,

The Arrow is flown,

The moment is gone,

The millennial year

Rushes on to our view, and Etemity’s here!

3.  O that each in the day

Of His coming might say

“I have fought my way thro’,

I have finish’d the work Thou didst give me to do!”

O that each from his Lord

May receive the glad word,

“Well and faithfully done,

Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne!
