# 687 9.9.9.9. with chorus

1.  Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,

Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,

Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured,

There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

Grace, grace, God’s grace,

Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;

Grace, grace, God’s grace,

Grace that is greater than all our sin.

2.  Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,

Threaten the soul with infinite loss;

Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,

Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

3.  Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,

What can avail to wash it away?

Look! there is flowing a crimson tide;

Whiter than snow you may be today.

4.  Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,

Freely bestowed on all who believe;

You that are longing to see His face,

Will you this moment His grace receive?
