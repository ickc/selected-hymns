# 543 12.8.12.8. with chorus

1.  On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,

The emblem of suffering and shame,

And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best

For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,

Till my trophies at last I lay down;

I will cling to the old rugged cross,

And exchange it some day for a crown

2.  Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,

Has a wondrous attraction for me;

For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,

To bear it to dark Calvary.

3.  In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,

A wondrous beauty I see;

For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,

To pardon and sanctify me.

4.  To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,

It’s shame and reproach gladly bear;

Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,

Where His glory forever I’ll share.
