# 221 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Church of God, beloved and chosen,

Church of Christ for whom He died,

Claim thy gifts and praise the Giver,

Ye are washed and sanctified.

Sanctified by God the Father,

And by Jesus Christ His Son,

And by God the Holy Spirit,

Holy, Holy, Three in One.

2.  By His will He sanctifieth,

By the Spirit’s power within;

By the loving hand that chasteneth

Fruits of righteousness to win;

By His truth and by His promise,

By the Word, His gift unpriced,

By His own blood, and by union

With the risen life of Christ.

3.  Holiness by faith in Jesus,

Not by effort of thine own,

Sin’s dominion crushed and broken

By the power of grace alone,

Christ, the holiness within thee,

His own beauty on thy brow:

This shall be thy pilgrim brightness,

This thy blessed portion now.

4.  He will sanctify thee wholly;

Body, spirit, soul shall be

Blameless till thy Savior’s coming

In His glorious majesty!

He hath perfected forever

Those whom He hath sanctified;

Spotless, glorious, and holy,

Is the Church, His chosen Bride.
