1.  Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, Tell with every breath,

That the Savior still is conqu’ror Over sin and death.

Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, Tell where’er you go,

That the Lord is still the conqu’ror, Over every foe.

2.  Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, Pain and sickness flee,

When we plead the mighty victory Won on Calvary.

3.  Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, Therefore do and dare;

Go wherever Jesus sends you In prevailing prayer.

4.  Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, No defeat nor fear

Evermore must dim thy vision! Christ the way will clear.

5.  Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, Soon His voice shall ring,

“Come ye conquerors, come up hither, Join thy conquering King.”
