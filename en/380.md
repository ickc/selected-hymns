1.  A charge to keep I have—

A God to glorify,

Who gave His Son my soul to save

And fit it for the sky.

2.  To serve the present age,

My calling to fulfill—

O may it all my pow’rs engage

To do my Master’s will!

3.  Arm me with jealous care,

As in Thy sight to live;

And O Thy servant, Lord, prepare

A strict account to give!

4.  Help me to watch and pray,

And on Thyself rely;

And let me ne’er my trust betray,

But press to realms on high.
