# 398 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,

For my very life art Thou;

Thee I take to all my problems

As the full solution now.

Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,

In all things Thy will be done;

I but a transparent vessel

To make visible the Son.

2.  Consecrated is Thy temple,

Purged from every stain and sin;

May Thy flame of glory now be

Manifested from within.

Let the earth in solemn wonder

See my body willingly

Offered as Thy slave obedient,

Energized alone by Thee.

3.  Every moment, every member,

Girded, waiting Thy command;

Underneath the yoke to labor

Or be laid aside as planned.

When restricted in pursuing,

No disquiet will beset;

Underneath Thy faithful dealing

Not a murmur or regret.

4.  Ever tender, quiet, restful,

Inclinations put away,

That Thou may for me choose freely

As Thy finger points the way.

Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me.

For my very life art Thou;

Thee I take to all my problems

As the full solution now.
