# 213 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  “Keep the incense burning”

On the altar fire;

Let thy heart’s petition,

Let thy deep desire,

Be a cloud of incense

Wreathing God’s own throne,

Till His will among us

Shall be fully done.

2.  “Keep the incense burning”

On the altar fire;

Feed the flame, Lord Jesus,

Till Thy whole desire

Shall in us, Thy children,

Find free course, and be

Breathed thro’ lips anointed

For this ministry.

3.  “Keep the incense burning”

Though thy faith be weak;

Though in words thou canst not

All thy longing speak;

Silent heart-petitions,

Spirit-taught, will be

Gloriously answered;

Wrought by God for thee.

4.  “Keep the incense burning”

Hourly let it rise,

Till from opened heavens,

Till from flame-swept skies,

Fire shall fall and kindle

All hearts to a flame;

Making us a glory

To our Savior’s name.
