# 314 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  My Father is omnipotent,

And that you can’t deny;

A God of might and miracles—

‘Tis written in the sky.

It took a miracle to put the stars in place,

It took a miracle to hang the world in space;

But when he saved my soul,

Cleansed and made me whole,

It took a miracle of love and grace!

2.  Though here His glory has been shown,

We still can’t fully see

The wonders of His might, His throne—

‘Twill take eternity.

3.  The Bible tells us of His power

And wisdom all way through,

And every little bird and flower

Are testimonies too.
