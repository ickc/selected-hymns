1.  Lamb of God! our souls adore Thee,

While upon Thy face we gaze;

There the Father’s love and glory

Shine in all their brightest rays;

Thine Almighty pow’r and wisdom

All creation’s works proclaim;

Heav’n and earth alike confess Thee

As the ever great “I AM.”

2.  Lamb of God! Thy Father’s bosom

Ever was Thy dwelling place;

His delight, in Him rejoicing,

One with Him in pow’r and grace;

O what wondrus love and mercy!

Whou didst lay Thy glory by;

And for us didst come from heaven

As the Lamb of God to die.

3.  Lamb of God! When we behold Thee

Lowly in the manger laid,

Wand’ring as a homeless stranger

In the world Thy hands had made;

When we see Thee in the garden

In Thine agony of blood,

At Thy grace we are confounded,

Holy, spotless Lamb of God!

4.  When we see Thee, as the victim,

Bound to the accursed tree,

For our guilt and folly stricken,

All our judgment borne by Thee,

Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,

Thou hast loved us unto blood;

Glory, glory everlasting

Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God.

5.  Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory

Wilt to this sad earth return;

All Thy foes shall quake before Thee,

All that now despise Thee mourn;

Then Thy saints all gathered to Thee,

With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;

Thine the praise and Thine the glory,

Lamb of God, for sinners slain!
