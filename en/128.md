Majesty, worship His majesty.

Unto Jesus be all glory, power and praise.

Majesty, kingdom authority

Flow from His throne unto His own,

His anthem raise.

So exalt, lift up on high the name of Jesus.

Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus, the King.

Majesty, worship His majesty.

Jesus, who died, now glorified,

King of all Kings.
