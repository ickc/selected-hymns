1.  O soul inspiring story—

God’s majesty and grace

In lustrous strokes of glory

Deep-carved in Jesus’ face!

Hearts rapt in contemplation

Of Godhead’s Image bright,

Break forth in adoration,

In wonder and delight!

2.  There Manhood, all perfection,

And Godhead-fullness shine;

God’s love and Man’s affection,

The human, the divine;

A life, a death, transcendent,

Revealing God as love:

Here, lowly Man, dependent

God over all, above!

3.  Unsullied blaze of glory!

O ever-radiant Face!

Thy rich, unfathomed story

Transfigures us in grace!

Made like Thee, soon, completely,

With love-lit eyes we’ll scan

God’s face unveiled so sweetly

In Thine, Thou Son of man!
