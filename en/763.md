Now is come salvation and strength

And the kingdom of our God

And the authority of His Christ:

For the accuser of our brethren is cast down

Which accused them before

our God day and night.

And they overcame him

by the blood of the Lamb,

And by the word of their testimony

And they loved not their soul lives unto death.

Therefore rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!
