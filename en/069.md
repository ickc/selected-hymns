1.  Meekness and majesty, manhood and Diety,

In perfect harmony, the Man who is God.

Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity;

Kneels in humility and washes our feet.

O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;

Bow down and worship, for this is your God.

2.  Father’s pure radiance, perfect in innocence;

Yet learns obedience to death on a cross.

Suff’ring to give us life, conquering through sacrifice;

And as they crucify prays, “Father, forgive.”

3.  Wisdom unsearchable, God, the invisible;

Love indestructible in frailty appears.

Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly;

Lifts our humanity to the heights of His throne.
