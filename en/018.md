# 018 8.7.8.7.

1.  There’s a wideness in God’s mercy

Like the wideness of the sea;

There’s a kindness in His justice

Which is more than liberty.

2.  There is welcome for the sinner

And more graces for the good;

There is mercy with the Savior;

There is healing in His blood.

3.  For the love of God is broader

Than the measure of man’s mind;

And the heart of the Eternal

Is most wonderfully kind.

4.  If our love were but more simple

We should take Him at His word,

And our lives would be all sunshine

In the sweetness of our Lord.
