1.  Thy Word is like a storehouse, Lord,

With full provision there,

And everyone who seeks may come,

Its glorious wealth to share.

Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine,

And jewels rich and rare

Are hidden in its mighty depths

For ev’ry searcher there.

2.  Thy Word is like a starry host:

A thousand rays of light

Are seen to guide the traveler,

And make his pathway bright.

Thy Word is like an armory,

Where soldiers may repair,

And find, for life’s long battle day,

All needful weapons there.

3.  O may I love Thy precious Word,

May I explore the mine,

May I its glorious riches take,

May light upon me shine.

O may I find my armor there,

Thy Word my trusty sword;

I’ll learn to fight with every foe

The battle of the Lord.

4.  Word of the ever living God,

Will of His glorious Son;

Without Thee how could earth be trod,

Or God and Christ be won?

Lord, grant us all aright to learn

The wisdom it imparts,

And to its heav’nly teaching turn,

With simple, child-like hearts.
