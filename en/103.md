1.  Thou, Lord, to death’s domain

Didst go alone.

Death had on Thee no claim,

Thou sinless One!

He who had death’s dread pow’r

Met Thee in that dark hour:

Vanquished by Thee his power,

By Thee alone.

2.  But Thou hast burst the grave,

Risen art Thou;

Death could not Thee enslave,

Death had to bow!

Victorious hast Thou come

Out of the darksome tomb,

Broken the bands of gloom:

Beyond death now.

3.  What mighty triumphs, Lord,

Thou didst achieve!

What fruitfulness doth God

From Thee receive!

Out of Thy death has sprung

A wondrous living throng:

All, all to Thee belong,

And in Thee live.

4.  Firstborn of all Thou art,

Lowly we bow;

Chief in Thy Father’s heart

Chief to us now.

Thou art indeed supreme,

Our great eternal theme,

Worthy of all esteem;

Worthy art Thou!
