1.  Christ is grace, coming to us from the Father above,

Bringing us back to God, the source, who is love.

We partake, through our Savior, of the nature divine—

Oh, how sublime!

Sisters: By the grace, Oh, the love

Brothers: that is flowing what a treasure,

Everyone: And the essence divine is saturating our soul.

Sisters: Into love Full and vast,

Brothers: we are growing; without measure,

Everyone: Will possess us and bring us to God’s goal.

2.  Christ is truth, coming to us as the Word, clear and bright

Bringing us back to God, the source, who is light.

We enjoy, through our Savior, the expression divine—

Through us to shine!

Sisters: By the truth Oh, the light,

Brothers: full of meaning, full of glory,

Everyone: Will possess us and fill the earth with praise.

Sisters: to the light Shining forth

Brothers: that is streaming all God’s story.

Everyone: We are coming and opening our hearts to its rays.
