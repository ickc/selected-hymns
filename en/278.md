# 278 8.8.8.6.

1.  O God of love to Thee we bow,

And pray for these before Thee now.

That, closely knit in holy vow,

They may in Thee be one.

2.  When days are filled with pure delight,

When paths are plain and skies are bright,

Walking by faith and not by sight,

May they in Thee be one.

3.  When stormy winds fulfill Thy will,

And all their good seems turned to ill,

Then, trusting Thee completely, still

May they in Thee be one.

4.  Whate’er in life shall be their share

Of quick’ning joy or burd’ning care,

In pow’r to do and grace to bear,

May they in Thee be one.

5.  Eternal Love, with them abide;

In Thee forever may they hide,

For even death cannot divide

Those whom Thou makest one.
