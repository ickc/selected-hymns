# 284 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  Of Jesus’ love that sought me,

When I was lost in sin;

Of wondrous grace that brought me

Back to His fold again;

Of heights and depths of mercy,

Far deeper than the sea,

And higher than the heavens,

My theme shall ever be.

Sweeter as the years go by,

Sweeter as the years go by;

Richer, fuller, deeper,

Jesus’ love is sweeter,

Sweeter as the years go by.

2.  He trod in old Judea

Life’s pathway long ago;

The people thronged about Him,

His saving grace to know.

He healed the broken-hearted,

And caused the blind to see;

And still His great heart yearneth

In love for even me.

3.  ’Twas wondrous love which led Him

For us to suffer loss—

To bear without a murmur

The anguish of the cross.

With saints redeemed in glory,

Let us our voices raise,

Till heav’n and earth re-echo

With our Redeemer’s praise.
