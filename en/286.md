# 286 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  I am amazed that God could ever love me,

So full of sin, so covered o’er with shame;

Make me to walk with Him who is above me,

Cleansed by the pow’r of His redeeming name.

I am amazed that God would ever save me,

Naught but the cross could take away my sin;

Thro’ faith in Christ eternal life He gave me,

Now He abides forevermore within.

2.  I am amazed that God would deign to bless me,

Choose me an heir to riches of His grace;

Till that perfection shall at last possess me,

He has reserved for all who seek His face.

3.  I am amazed that God should grant salvation,

To such as I and all who heed His word;

Eternal life to ev’ry land and nation,

This is the wondrous message we have heard.
