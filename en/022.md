1.  “Great is Thy faithfulness,” O God my Father,

There is no shadow of turning. with Thee;

Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not*;* As Thou hast been
Thou forever wilt be.

""Great is Th y faithfulness!"" ""Great is Thy faithfulness!"" Morning by
morning new mercies I see;

All I have needed Thy hand hath provided-

""Great is Thy faithfulness,"" Lord, unto me!

2.  Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,

Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,

Join with all nature in manifold witness

To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

3.  Pardon for sin and a peace that, endureth,

Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;

Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,

Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
