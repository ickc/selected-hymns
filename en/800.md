1.  Father, I know that all my life

Is portioned out for me;

The changes that are sure to come

I do not fear to see;

I ask Thee for a present mink,

Intent on pleasing Thee.

2.  I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,

Through constant watching

To meet the glad with joyful

To wipe the weeping eyes,

A heart at leisure from itself,

To soothe and sympathize.

3.  I would not have the restless will

That hurries to and fro,

Seeking for some great thing to do,

Or secret thing to know;

I would be treated as a child,

And guided where I go.

4.  Wherever in the world I am,

In what-soe'er estate,

I have a fellowship with hearts

To keep and cultivate;

A work of lowly love to do

For Him on whom I wait.

5.  I ask Thee for the daily strength,

To none that ask denied,

A mind to blend with outward life,

While keeping at Thy side;

Content to fill a little space,

If Thou be glorified.

6.  On every path there is untruth,

That I might patient be;

In every way there is a cross,

That I might lean on Thee.

A lowly heart will find each place

A paradise for me.

7.  And if some things I ask not in

My cup of blessing be,

I'd have my spirit filled the more

With grateful love to Thee;

More carefulâ€”not to serve Thee much,

But please Thee perfectly.

8.  In service which Thy will appoints,

There are no bonds for me;

My inmost heart is taught the truth

That makes Thy children free;

A life of self-renouncing love

Is one of liberty.
