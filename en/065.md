1.  There is no name so sweet on earth,

No name so sweet in heaven,

The name, before his wondrous birth

To Christ the Savior given.

We love to sing of Christ our King,

And hail Him, blessed Jesus;

For there’s no word ear ever heard

So dear, so sweet as “Jesus.”

2.  And when He hung upon the tree,

They wrote this name above Him;

That all might see the reason we

Forevermore must love Him.

3.  So now, upon His Father’s throne,

Almighty to release us

From sin and pain, He gladly reigns,

The Prince and Savior, Jesus.

4.  O Jesus, by that matchless name,

Thy grace shall fail us never;

Today as yesterday the same,

Thou art the same forever.
