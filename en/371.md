# 371 6.4.6.4. with chorus

1.  I need Thee every hour,

Most gracious Lord;

No tender voice like Thine

Can peace afford.

I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;

Every hour I need Thee;

Oh, bless me now, my Savior!

I come to Thee.

2.  I need Thee every hour,

Stay Thou near by;

Temptations lose their power

When Thou art nigh.

3.  I need Thee every hour,

In joy or pain;

Come quickly and abide,

Or life is vain.

4.  I need Thee every hour,

Teach me Thy will;

And Thy rich promises

In me fulfill.

5.  I need Thee every hour,

Most Holy One;

Oh, make meâ€™ Thine indeed,

Thou blessed Son.
