# 841 8.9.8.9.D.

1.  I hear my risen Savior say:

“Follow me, follow me, follow me”;

His voice is calling all the day,

“Follow me, follow me, follow me.

For thee I trod the bitter way,

For thee I gave my life away,

And drank the gall thy debt to pay,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.”

2.  ""Tho' thou hast sinn'd, I'll pardon thee,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

From ev'ry sin I'll set thee free,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

In all thy changing life I'll be

Thy God, thy guide on land and sea,

Thy bliss thro' all eternity,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.""

3.  ""Bring unto me thy many cares,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

Thy heavy load my arm upbears,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

Lean on my breast, dismiss thy fears,

And trust me thro' thy future years,

My hand shall wipe away all tears,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.""
