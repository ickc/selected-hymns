1.  “Ask in faith,” the Name of Jesus

All your plea before the throne;

As you trust, the Lord will whisper,

“See, my child, the work is done.”

2.  “Ask in faith,” God waits to answer

Each petition, Spirit-wrought;

He will work in wondrous power,

Far beyond your highest thought.

3.  “Ask in faith,” ’tis just the asking,

In a faith that dares to stand,

Full of joyful expectation,

With an open, outstretched hand.

4.  “Ask in faith,” for God is waiting

For thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.

Faith delights Him; faith can touch Him,

Every moment, everywhere.
