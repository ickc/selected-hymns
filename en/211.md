# 211 8.7.8.7.D. with repeat (Repeat the last line of each stanza)

1.  In the secret of His presence

How my soul delights to hide!

Oh, how precious are the lessons

Which I learn at Jesus’ side!

Earthly cares can never vex me,

Neither trials lay me low;

For when Satan comes to tempt me,

To the secret place I go.

2.  When my soul is faint and thirsty,

‘Neath the shadow of His wing

There is cool and pleasant shelter,

And a fresh and crystal spring;

And my Savior rests beside me,

As we hold communion sweet;

If I tried, I could not utter

What He says when thus we meet.

3.  Only this I know: I tell Him

All my doubts and griefs and fears;

Oh, how patiently He listens!

And my drooping soul He cheers;

Do you think He ne’er reproves me?

What a false friend He would be,

If He never, never told me

Of the sins which He must see!

4.  Would you like to know that sweetness

Of the secret of the Lord?

Go and hide beneath His shadow;

This shall then be your reward;

And whene’er you leave the silence

Of that happy meeting-place,

By the Spirit bear the image

Of the Master in your face.
