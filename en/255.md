# 255 8.6.8.6.

1.  According to Thy gracious word,

In meek humility,

This will I do, my dying Lord,

I will remember Thee.

2.  Thy body, broken for my sake,

My bread from heaven shall be;

Thy testamental cup I take,

And thus remember Thee.

3.  Gethsemane can I forget?

Or there Thy conflict see,

Thine agony and bloody sweat,

And not remember Thee?

4.  When to the cross I turn mine eyes

And rest on Calvary,

O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,

I must remember Theeâ€”

5.  Remember Thee and all Thy pains

And all Thy love to me;

Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,

I will remember Thee.

6.  And when these failing lips grow dumb

And mind and memory flee,

When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,

Jesus, remember me.
