# 085 7.7.7.7.

1.  Crowned with thorns upon the tree,

Silent in Thine agony;

Dying, crushed beneath the load

Of the wrath and curse of God.

2.  On Thy pale and suff’ring brow,

Mystery of love and woe;

On Thy grief and sore amaze,

Savior, I would fix my gaze!

3.  On Thy holy, loving breast

Thou dost bid the weary rest;

Rest there from the world’s false ways,

Rest there from its vanities.

4.  Rest in pardon and relief,

From the load of guilt and grief;

Rest in Thy redeeming blood,

Rest in perfect peace with God.

5.  Sin-atoning Sacrifice,

Thou art precious in mine eyes;

Thou alone my rest shall be,

Now and thro’ eternity.
