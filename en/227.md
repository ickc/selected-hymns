# 227 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd

Brought us right out of the fold

Into His pasture so plenteous,

Into His riches untold.

Glorious church life,

Feasting from such a rich store!

Here where weâ€™re dwelling in oneness

God commands life evermore.

2.  In the divisions He sought us,

Weary and famished for food;

Into the good land He brought us,

Oh, to our spirit how good!

3.  Jesus Himself is our pasture,

He is the food that we eat;

We as His sheep are fed richly

Each time, whenever we meet.

4.  Dwell we here on a high mountain,

Wet with the morning-fresh dew,

Quenching our thirst at the fountain,

Water so living and new.

5.  Christ is our rest and enjoyment,

Here we have nothing to fear;

Here all the sheep dwell securely,

Kept by His presence so dear.
