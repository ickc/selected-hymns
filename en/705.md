# 705 6.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  I’ve wandered far away from God,

Now I’m coming home;

The paths of sin too long I’ve trod,

Lord, I’m coming home.

Coming home, coming home,

Nevermore to roam;

Open wide Thine arms of love;

Lord, I’m coming home.

2.  I’ve wasted many precious years,

Now I’m coming home;

I now repent with bitter tears,

Lord, I’m coming home.

3.  I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord,

Now I’m coming home;

I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;

Lord, I’m coming home.

4.  My soul is sick, my heart is sore,

Now I’m coming home;

My strength renew, my hope restore:

Lord, I’m coming home.

5.  My only hope, my only plea,

Now I’m coming home;

That Jesus died, and died for me;

Lord, I’m coming home.

6.  I need His cleansing blood, I know,

Now I’m coming home;

O wash me whiter than the snow;

Lord, I’m coming home.
