# 028 13.8.13.8. with chorus

1.  We are never never weary of the grand old song;

Glory to God, hallelujah!

We can sing it loud as ever wih our faith more strong;

Glory to God, hallelujah!

O the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing,

For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the

wing,

We are going by and by to the presence of the King!

Glory to God, hallelujah!

2.  We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love:

Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are seeking every moment all its grace to prove:

Glory to God, hallelujah!

3.  We are going on to glory as the Lord has told:

Glory to God, hallelujah!

Where the King in all His beauty we shall soon behold:

Glory to God, hallelujah!

4.  There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song;

Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the

blood-washed throng,

Glory to God, hallelujah!
