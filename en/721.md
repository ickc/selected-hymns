# 721 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  Tell me the old, old story,

Of unseen things above,

Of Jesus and His glory,

Of Jesus and His love;

Tell me the story simply,

As to a little child,

For I am weak and weary,

And helpless and defiled.

Tell me the old, old story,

Tell me the old, old story,

Tell me the old, old story,

Of Jesus and His love.

2.  Tell me the story slowly,

That I may take it in—

That wonderful redemption,

God’s remedy for sin;

Tell me the story often,

For I forget so soon,

The “early dew” of morning

Has passed away at noon.

3.  Tell me the story softly,

With earnest tones and grave;

Remember I’m the sinner

Whom Jesus came to save;

Tell me the story always,

If you would really be,

In any time of trouble,

A comforter to me.

4.  Tell me the same old story,

When you have cause to fear

That this world’s empty glory

Is costing me too dear;

And when the Lord’s bright glory

Is dawning on my soul,

Tell me the old, old story:

“Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”
