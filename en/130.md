1.  O blessed Savior, Son of God!

Who hast redeemed us with Thy blood

From Guilt, and death, and shame,

With joy and praise, Thy people see

The crown of glory worn by Thee,

And worthy Thee proclaim,

And worthy Thee proclaim.

2.  Exalted, by the Father’s love,

All thrones, and powers, and names above,

At God’s right hand in heav’n;

Wisdom and riches, pow’r divine,

Blessing and honor, Lord, are Thine—

All things to Thee are giv’n,

All things to Thee are giv’n.

3.  Head of the Church! Thou sittest there,

Thy members all the blessings share

Thy blessing, Lord is ours.

Our life Thou art—Thy grace sustains.

Thy strength in us each victory gains

O’er sin and Satan’s pow’r,

O’er sin and Satan’s pow’r.

4.  And soon, the day of glory come,

Thy bride shall reach her destined home

And all Thy beauty see.

How great our joy to see Thee shine,

To hear Thee own us, Lord, as Thine,

And ever dwell with Thee,

And ever dwell with Thee.
