# 471 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  This is my wonderful story,

Christ to my heart has come;

Jesus, the King of Glory,

Finds in my heart a home.

Christ in me, Christ in me,

Christ in me, O wonderful story,

Christ in me, Christ in me,

Christ in me, the hope of glory.

2.  Was there e’er story so moving,

Story of love and pain;

Was there e’er Bridegroom so loving,

Seeking our hearts to gain.

3.  I am so glad I received Him,

Jesus my heart’s dear King;

I who so often have grieved Him,

All to His feet would bring.

4.  How can I ever be lonely,

How can I ever fall;

What can I want, if only

Christ is my all in all?

5.  Now in His bosom confiding,

This my glad song shall be;

I am in Christ abiding,

And Christ abides in me.
