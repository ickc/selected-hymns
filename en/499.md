1.  Marvel not that Christ in glory

All my inmost heart hath won;

Not a star to cheer my darkness,

But a light beyond the sun.

All below lies dark and shadowed,

Nothing here to claim my heart,

Save the lonely track of sorrow

Where of old He walked apart.

2.  Others in the earthly sunshine

Wearily may journey on,

I have seen a light from heaven

Past the brightness of the sun—

Light that knows no cloud, no waning,

Light wherein I see His face,

All His love’s uncounted treasures,

All the riches of His grace:

3.  All the wonders of His glory,

Deeper wonders of His love—

How for me He won, He keepeth

That high standing all above;

Not a glimpse—the veil uplifted—

But within the veil to dwell,

Gazing on His face forever,

Hearing words unspeakable.

4.  I have seen the face of Jesus—

Tell me not of aught beside;

I have heard the voice of Jesus—

All my soul is satisfied.

In the radiance of the glory

First I saw His blessed face,

And forever shall that glory

Be my home, my dwelling-place.
