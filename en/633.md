# 633 8.8.8.8.

1.  With all the pow’r in heav’n and earth

Our resurrected Lord’s endued;

If we unite and live by Him,

The enemy will be subdued.

2.  In Jesus’ name we must declare

That we shall overcome the foe;

We draw authority from Him

The serpent’s head to crush below.

3.  No matter what, thou mountain high,

In heav’n or earth, where’er thou art,

At any cost we’ll level thee,

In Jesus’ name thou must depart!

4.  Faith orders thee “Remove from here,

And be thou cast into the sea!”

We should, we must, we can, we will,

Fulfill God’s purpose faithfully.
