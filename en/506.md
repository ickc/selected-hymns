# 506 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  He’s the vine and we’re the branches,

We should e’er abide in Him,

And let Him abide within us

As the flow of life within.

In the vine, in the vine,

In the vine, in the vine,

We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,

E’er abiding in the vine.

2.  As we hear His instant speaking,

He’s the rich indwelling Word;

To abide we must be faithful

To the speaking that we’ve heard.

3.  For ’tis here we know abiding

In the real and deepest way;

If we love our Lord completely,

We would do whate’er He’d say.

4.  Then His love abides within us,

And in love abiding, we

Know the joy of life-communion,

Full and perfect harmony.

5.  Oh, how precious this abiding,

Oh, how intimate and sweet;

As the fruit of life is added,

And our joy is made complete.
