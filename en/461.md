# 461 8.8.8.8.

1.  Jesus, my Savior! Thou art mine,

The Father’s gift of love divine;

All Thou hast done, and all Thou art,

Are now the portion of my heart.

2.  Poor, feeble, wretched, as I am,

I now can glory in Thy name;

Now cleansed in Thy most precious blood

And made the righteousness of God.

3.  All that Thou hast Thou hast for me,

All my fresh springs are hid in Thee;

In Thee I live; While I confess

I nothing am, yet all possess.

4.  O Savior, teach me to abide

Close sheltered at Thy wounded side,

Each hour receiving “grace on grace,”

Until I see Thee face to face.
