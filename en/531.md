# 531 11.10.11.10.

1.  Out of the depths of darkness, death, and anguish,

Christ lifted me and brought me to His throne.

No more enslaved by Satan’s dark delusions,

With Christ transcendent, I am His alone.

2.  Out of the depths of weakness and frustration,

Set on the mount of praise and perfect peace;

Resting in Him, I know the sweet fulfillment

Of life within that flows in blest release.

3.  Out of the depths of fear and disappointment,

Set on the mount of splendor, joy, and grace;

Reigning with Christ, I taste His satisfaction;

Feasting with Him, I glimpse the Bridegroom’s face.
