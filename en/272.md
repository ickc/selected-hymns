# 272 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  Work, for the Day is coming,

Day in the Word foretold,

When, ‘mid the scenes triumphant,

Long’d for by saints of old,

He, who on earth a stranger

Travers’d its paths of pain,

Jesus, the Prince, the Savior,

Comes evermore to reign.

2.  Work, for the Day is coming,

Darkness will soon be gone;

Then o’er the night of weeping

Day without end shall dawn,

What now we sow in sadness

Then we shall reap in joy;

Hope will be chang’d to gladness,

Praise be our blest employ.

3.  Work for the Day is coming,

Made for the saints of light;

Off with the garments dreary,

On with the armor bright:

Soon will the strife be ended,

Soon all our toils below:

Not to the dark we’re tending,

But to the Day we go.

4.  Work, for the Lord is coming,

Children of light are we:

From Jesus’ bright appearing,

Powers of darkness flee.

Out of the mist, at His bidding.

Souls like the dew are born:

O’er all the East are spreading

Tints of the rosy morn.

5.  Work, then, the Day is coming,

No time for sighing now;

Prize for the race awaits thee,

Wreaths for the victor’s brow.

Now morning Light is breaking,

Soon will the Day appear;

Night shades appall no longer,

Jesus, our Lord, is near.
