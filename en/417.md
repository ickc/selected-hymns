1.  Prince of peace, control my will;

Bid this struggling heart be still:

Bid my fears and doubtings cease:

Hush my spirit into peace.

2.  Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,

Opened wide the gate to God;

Peace I ask, but peace must be,

Lord, in being one with Thee.

3.  May Thy will, not mine be done;

May Thy will and mine be one;

Chase these doubtings from my heart,

Now Thy perfect peace impart.

4.  Savior, at Thy feet I fall,

Thou, my life, my God, my all;

Let Thy happy servant be

One forevermore with Thee.
