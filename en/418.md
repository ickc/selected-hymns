# 418 8.8.8.4.

1.  When I am in the natural man,

How very strong I feel I am,

I do not know, I cannot scan How weak I am.

2.  When in the world I have my life,

I cannot sense my failure rife,

But boasting in my earnest strife,

I forward press.

3.  When I within the darkness dwell,

My shallow state I cannot tell,

I only think how I excel,

And proudly dream.

4.  But when at last I come to Thee,

Thy searching light uncovers me,

I see what I could never see—

Myself exposed.

5.  I wither ‘neath Thy piercing ray,

And all my strength dissolves away,

My self-esteem in dust I lay,

And lowly bow.

6.  How blind and foolish is the pride

With which my soul was fortified;

From my dark heart, self-satisfied,

It issued forth.

7.  There’s not a thing that pride can claim,

There’s not a member but is lame,

There’s only deep regret and shame,

How can I pray?

8.  Thy blood from judgment saveth me,

Thy life from wrath delivers me,

How filthy yet in poverty

I really am.

9.  I want to pray, but faith have not,

I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.

Oh, canst Thou e’er renew my heart,

Have mercy, Lord!
