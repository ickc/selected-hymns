For the Son of Thy love,

For our Savior who died and

Is now gone above.

Hallelujah! Amen;

Hallelujah! Thine the glory,

We praise Thee again.

For Thy Spirit of light,

And scattered our night.

To the Lamb that was slain,

Who has home all our sins,

And has cleansed every stain.

We are filled with Thy love,

And each heart is rekindled

With fire from above.
