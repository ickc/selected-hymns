1.  Jesus,Thy blood and righteousness.

My beauty are, my glorious dress;

Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,

With joy shall I lift up my head.

2.  Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,

Which, at the mercy seat of God,

Forever doth for sinners plead,

For me, eâ€™en for my soul, was shed.

3.  Lord, I believe were sinners more

Than sands upon the ocean shore,

Thou hast for all a ransom paid,

For all a full redemption made.

4.  Bold shall I stand in that great day,

For who aught to my charge shall lay?

Fully, by Thee, absolved I am

From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.

5.  This spotless robe the same appears,

When ruined nature sinks in years;

No age can change its glorious hue,

Its glory is forever new.

6.  Thou God of power, Thou God of love,

Let many more, Thy mercy prove;

Their beauty this, their glorious dress,

Jesus the Lord, our Righteousness.
