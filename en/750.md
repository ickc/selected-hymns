# 750. Irregular Meterâ€”Isaiah 12:3,4,6

1. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water

Out of the wells of salvation.

And in that day shall ye say,

Praise the Lord.

Call upon His name, declare His doings among the people,

Make mention that His name is exalted.

Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion:

For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
