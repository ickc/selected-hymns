# 244 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  The churches are the Body

Of Christ on earth today.

They are His testimony,

That He may have a way.

They are the golden lampstands

In cities far and wide.

They are His fighting army,

And His beloved Bride.

The churches, the churches,

Upon the earth today;

Lord stir our hearts for Thy desire,

And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

2.  Oh, how we need the churches,

All of them, great or small!

We need their many portions

To profit us withal.

Yes, Lord, enlarge the churches;

We love their needs to bear.

Enlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,

In fellowship and prayer.

3.  The Lord’s eyes o’er the whole earth

Are running to and fro;

Those seven, burning, searching,

Our heart’s desire to know.

His purpose—many churches,

Built up in one accord;

This golden testimony

Will thus express the Lord.

4.  And soon will be the coming

Of our triumphant King!

He’s coming for the churches

Where His sweet praises ring.

Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,

As draws the harvest nigh,

And to Thy throne do take us,

To reign with Thee on high.
