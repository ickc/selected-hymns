1.  Oh, who’s like our Jesus? He’s all we desire!

His love draws us near sets our spirits afire!

We cannot but love Him As one we proclaim: “Lord

Jesus, we love Thee exalt Thy dear name!”

2.  O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest—

Our Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest:

Thy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song;

Thy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue!

3.  O Jesus, our Jesus, how can we express

Thy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness?

When we see Thy beauty, all else fades away—

All shadows must flee at the breaking of day!

4.  We love Thee, we love Thee, we love Thee, O Lord.

We love Thee, our Jesus, we love Thee, our God!

We love Thee, we love Thee, and that Thou dost know;

As we’re in Thy presence, love for Thee will grow!
