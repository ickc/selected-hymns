# 676 7.5.7.5.D.

1.  Nothing either great or small—

Nothing, sinner, no;

Jesus did it, did it all,

Long, long ago.

“It is finished!” yes, indeed,

Finished every jot:

Sinner, this is all you need—

Tell me, is it not?

2.  When He, from His lofty throne,

Stooped to do and die,

Everything was fully done;

Hearken to His cry:

3.  Weary, working, burdened one,

Wherefore toil you so?

Cease your doing; all was done

Long, long ago.

4.  Till to Jesus’ work you cling

By a simple faith,

“Doing” is a deadly thing—

“Doing” ends in death.

5.  Cast your deadly “doing” down—Down at Jesus’ feet;

Stand in Him, in Him alone, Gloriously complete.
