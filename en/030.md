1.  O gracious God, Thy pleasure

Is in Thy Christ made known,

And tells the boundless measure

Of blessing for Thine own.

He has Thy presence entered,

As Man in heav’n is known;

In Him Thy glory’s centered,

In Him Thy purpose shown.

2.  And O what love is beaming

Refulgent in that face!

What blessed light is streaming

From that most glorious place!

Both love and light proclaiming

What Thou, the Father, art,

And wondrous grace revealing,

With Thine own Son, our part.

3.  Thou source of every blessing!

Thou spring of all delight!

Thy name with joy confessing

Let all the saints unite!

Each heart its praise outpouring

To Thee all praise above,

Each voice in strains adoring

Re-echoes—”God is love.”
