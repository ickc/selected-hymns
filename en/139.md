# 139 8.6.8.6.

1.  O blessed Savior, is Thy love

So great! So full! So free!

Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,

Our lives, engaged with Thee.

2.  We love Thee for the glorious worth

Which in Thyself we see;

We love Thee for that shameful cross,

Endured so patiently.

3.  No man of greater love can boast

Than for His friend to die;

Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!

What love with Thine can vie?

4.  Though in the very form of God,

With heav’nly glory crowned,

Thou didst a servant’s form assume,

Beset with sorrow round.

5.  Thou wouldst like wretched man be made

In everything but sin,

That we as like Thee might become

As we unlike had been:

6.  Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,

In every beauteous grace;

From glory unto glory changed,

Till we behold Thy face.

7.  O Lord, we treasure in our hearts

The memory of Thy love;

And ever shall Thy name to us

A grateful odor prove.
