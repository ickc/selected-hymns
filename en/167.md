# 167 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,

Whose life our ransom paid,

Whose blood a full redemption

For all the world has made:

Let ev’ry heart adore Him;

Let ev’ry creature sing

Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,

Our Savior and our King.

Ten thousand thanks, then thousand thanks.

We’ll praise Him o’er and o’er,

And for the life with Him to live,

Ten thousand thousand more.

2.  Ten thousand hearts to Jesus

How gladly would we give;

Ten thousand lives to Jesus,

Had we so long to live;

Ten thousand tongues shall praise Him,

Ten thousand songs ascend

To Him, our blest Redeemer,

To Him, our dearest Friend.

3.  Ten thousand thanks to Jesus

For blessing ev’ry hour;

Ten thousand times ten thousand,

For love’s redeeming pow’r;

And when He comes in glory

His blessed face we’ll see,

His love thro’ endless ages

Our sweetest song shall be.
