# 378 9.9.9.10. with chorus

1.  Fill all my vision, Savior, I pray,

Let me see only Jesus today;

Thoâ€™ through the valley Thou leadest me,

Thy fadeless glory encompasseth me.

Fill all my vision, Savior divine,

Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.

Fill all my vision, that all may see

Thy Holy Image reflected in me.

2.  Fill all my vision, every desire

Keep for Thy glory; my soul inspire

With Thy perfection, Thy holy love,

Flooding my pathway with light from above.

3.  Fill all my vision, let naught of sin

Shadow the brightness shining within.

Let me see only Thy blessed face,

Feasting my soul on Thy infinite grace.
