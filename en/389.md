# 389 7.7.7.8.D.

1.  I am weak, but Thou art strong;

Jesus, keep me from all wrong;

I’ll be satisfied as long

As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Just a closer walk with Thee,

Grant it, Jesus, from all wrong;

Daily walking close to Thee,

Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

2.  Thru this world of toil and snares,

If I falter, Lord, who cares?

Who with me my burden shares?

None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

3.  When my feeble life is o’er,

Time for me will be no more:

On that bright eternal shore,

I will walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.
