# 031 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  By Thee, O God, invited,

We look unto the Son,

In whom Thy heart delighted,

Who all Thy will hath done;

And by the one chief treasure

Thy bosom freely gave,

Thine own pure love we measure,

Thy willing mind to save.

2.  O God of mercy—Father!

The one unchanging claim,

The brightest hopes, we gather

From Christ’s most precious name:

What always sounds so sweetly

In Thine unwearied ear,

Has freed our souls completely

From all our guilt and fear.

3.  The trembling sinner feareth

That God can ne’er forget;

But one full payment cleareth

His memory of all debt.

When nought beside could free us,

Or set our souls at large,

The death of God’s Beloved

Secured a full discharge.

4.  No wrath God’s heart retaineth

To usward who believe;

No dread in ours remaineth

As we His love receive;

Returning sons He kisses,

And with His robe invests;

His perfect love dismisses

All terror from our breasts.
