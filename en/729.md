# 729 8.8.6.8.8.6.6. with chorus

1.  A hundred thousand souls a day

Are passing one by one away

In Christless guilt and gloom;

Without one ray of hope or light,

With future dark as endless night,

They’re passing to their doom,

They’re passing to their doom.

They’re passing, passing fast away

In thousands day be day;

They’re passing to their doom,

They’re passing to their doom.

2.  O Holy Ghost, Thy people move,

Baptize their hearts with faith and love

And consecrate their gold.

At Jesus’ feet their millions pour,

And all their ranks unite once more,

As in the days of old,

As in the days of old.

3.  The Master’s coming draweth near;

The Son of Man will soon appear;

His kingdom is at hand.

But ere that glorious day can be,

This gospel of the kingdom we

Must preach in every land,

Must preach in every land.

4.  Oh, let us then His coming haste,

Oh, let us end this awful waste

Of souls that never die.

For many millions still are lost;

A Savior’s blood has paid the cost,

Oh, hear their dying cry,

Oh, hear their dying cry.

5.  They’re passing, passing fast away,

A hundred thousand souls a day

In Christ-less guilt and gloom.

O Church of Christ, what wilt thou say

When, in the awful judgment day,

They charge thee with their doom,

They charge thee with their doom?
