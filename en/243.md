# 243 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  See the golden lampstands,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Jesus’ testimony,

Bearing Him as light.

Formed by Him, unmeasured,

In the Spirit’s mold—

All are one in nature,

One pure work of gold.

See the golden lampstand,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Burning in the Spirit,

Shining forth with Christ.

2.  God in Christ, embodied,

As God’s lampstand, He

Has become the Spirit,

The reality.

Spirit as the lampstand

Has been multiplied;

Many golden lampstands,

Now are realized!

3.  Caring for the churches

Is the Son of Man:

Voice of many waters,

Stars in His right hand;

Eyes aflame; His face is

Shining as the sun;

Churches—fear no trial,

He’s the living One!

4.  What can quench the lampstands?

Who can them defy?

More the opposition—

More they multiply!

Deeper darkness ‘round them,

Brighter do they shine.

They are constituted

With the life divine.

5.  Soon the golden lampstands

Shall the Bride become,

Bringing in that city—

New Jerusalem.

Then the many lampstands

Shall one lampstand be;

Triune God expressing,

Universally.

Lo, from heav’n descending,

All the earth shall see

God’s complete expression,

For eternity.
