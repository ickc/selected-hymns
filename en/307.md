# 307 11.10.7.7.10. with chorus

1.  I remember when my burdens rolled away,

I had carried them for years, night and day;

When I sought the blessed Lord,

And I took Him at His word,

Then at once all my burdens rolled away.

Rolled away, rolled away,

I am happy since my burdens rolled away;

Rolled away, rolled away,

I am happy since my burdens rolled away.

2.  I remember when my burdens rolled away,

That I feared would never leave, night or day;

Jesus showed to me the loss,

So I left them at the cross;

I was glad when my burdens rolled away.

3.  I remember when my burdens rolled away,

That had hindered me for years, night and day;

As I sought the throne of grace,

Just a glimpse of Jesus’ face,

And I knew that my burdens could not stay.

4.  I am singing since my burdens rolled away,

There’s a song within my heart, night and day;

I am living for my King,

And with joy I shout and sing

Hallelu, all my burdens rolled away.
