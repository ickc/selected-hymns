# 403 8.6.8.6.

1.  Oh, for a heart to praise my God,

A heart from sin set free,

A heart that’s sprinkled with the blood

So freely shed for me.

2.  A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

My dear Redeemer’s throne;

Where only Christ is heard to speak,

Where Jesus reigns alone.

3.  A humble, lowly, contrite heart,

Believing, true, and clean,

Which neither death nor life can part

From Him that dwells within.

4.  A heart in every thought renewed,

And filled with love divine;

Perfect and right, and pure and good,

A copy, Lord, of Thine.

5.  Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart,

Come quickly frown above;

Write Thy new name upon my heart,

Thy new, best name of Love.
