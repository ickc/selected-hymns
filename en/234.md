Welcome to the family,

We’re glad that you have come

To share your life with us,

As we grow in love,

And may we always be to you

What God would have us be,

A fam’ly always there,

To be strong and to lean on.

May we learn to love each other

More with each new day,

May words of love be on our lips

In ev’rything we say.

May the Spirit melt our hearts

And teach us how to pray,

That we might be a true family.
