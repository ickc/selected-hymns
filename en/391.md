1.  Jesus, Savior, pilot me

Over life’s tempestuous sea;

Unknown waves before me roll,

Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal;

Chart and compass come from Thee;

Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

2.  As a mother stills her child,

Thou canst hush the ocean wild;

Boist’rous waves obey Thy will

When Thou say’st to them, “Be still.”

Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,

Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

3.  Though death’s valley I may pass,

Still Thy grace will fear surpass;

In Thy presence I will rest,

And, while leaning on Thy breast,

I will hear Thee say to me,

“Fear not, I will pilot thee.”
