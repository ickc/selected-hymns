# 161 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  O Jesus Lord, when present at Thy table,

And on the bread and on the wine we gaze;

We praise Thee, Lord, that Thou as food art able

To be enjoyed by man in many ways.

So all our being sings in praise to Thee,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

Of Thee we’ll eat through all eternity,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

2.  O what a shame—when Christ with all His riches,

Has come into the world, life to supply—

That man would live, not by Him, but by teachings,

So powerless these riches to apply.

But all we need to do is eat the Lord;

He’s marvelous, He’s wonderful!

And as we eat, we’re inwardly restored;

Christ grows in us, grows to the full.

3.  O Jesus Christ, Thou camest not to mankind

To be a king, to rule us outwardly.

But Thou hast come as food to satisfy us,

And by Thy life to guide us inwardly.

So all our being sings in praise to Thee,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

Of Thee we’ll eat through all eternity,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

4.  We praise Thee, Lord, for all Thy glorious grandeur,

For all Thy strength and majesty replete;

And yet, O Lord, what special thanks we give Thee,

That all Thou art is small enough to eat.

So all our being sings in praise to Thee,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

Of Thee we’ll eat through all eternity,

How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
