# 108 7.6.7.6.D. Psalm 45 - Part 1

1.  Our hearts are overflowing

To speak a goodly thing—

To tell what we’ve experienced

Of our exalted King.

Our tongues as pens are ready,

We’ve volumes here to “write”—

The glories of our Bridegroom,

Our Lord and our delight.

2.  Lord Jesus, Thou art fairer

Than all the sons of men;

Thy goodness is transcendent—

Hallelujah! Amen!

Upon Thy lips most holy

Abundant grace is poured;

Forever God has blessed Thee,

Our gracious, glorious Lord!

3.  Thou art the mighty Warrior

Who rides to victory;

In Thy majestic glory

Ride on triumphantly

The peoples fall beneath Thee—

The conquering One Thou art.

Thine arrows in their sharpness

Have entered Satan’s heart!

4.  Thy throne, O God, forever

And ever shall endure;

The sceptre of Thy kingdom

Upon the earth is sure.

’Tis with the oil of gladness

God has anointed Thee

Above all Thy companions

How worthy there to be!

5.  Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia

Do all Thy garments smell:

Thy death and resurrection

Do all Thy deeds forthtell.

Out of Thy tabernacles

Shall praises make Thee glad,

And praises upon praises

Thy joyful saints shall add.
