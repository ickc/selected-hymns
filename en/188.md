# 188 8.7.8.7. D.

1.  Of the Spirit, born of Spirit—

This the source of Jesusis;

Filled with Spirit, all of Spirit—

This the essence truly His.

In the Spirit, with the Spirit,

As the Spirit Jesus came;

Now the Lord is just that Spirit

And in spirit we’re the same.

2.  Baptized in the Holy Spirit,

In the Spirit we’re immersed;

All the church is born of Spirit,

Living water has outburst.

In the Spirit, in the Spirit

Brothers, this is all we need.

Now the church must be in Spirit,

Not in teaching, form, or creed.

3.  The communion of the Spirit

Is the fellowship we share;

All the brothers, all the sisters

Only for the Spirit care.

Now the Spirit in the churches

Speaks to those who have an ear.

Seven Spirits for the churches

Are our blessed portion here.

4.  “Come and drink the living water,”

Say the Spirit and the Bride—

Church and Spirit speak together,

Utterly identified.

Just according to the Spirit

Must be our reality;

Just the Spirit in the churches

Is the Lord’s recovery.
