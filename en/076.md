1.  Jesus! Source of life eternal!

Jesus, Author of our breath!

Victor o’er the hosts infernal,

By defeat, and shame, and death,

Thou thro’ deepest tribulation

Deigned to pass for our salvation:

Thousand, thousand praises be,

Lord of glory, unto Thee!

2.  Thou, O Son of God! wert bearing

Cruel mockings, hatred, scorn;

Thou, the King of glory, wearing,

For our sake, the crown of thorn:

Dying, Thou didst us deliver

From the chains of sin for ever;

Thousand, thousand praises be,

Precious Savior, unto Thee!

3.  All the shame men heaped upon

The Thou didst patiently endure;

Not the pains of death too bitter,

Our redemption to procure;

Wondrous Thy humiliation

To accomplish our salvation:

Thousand, thousand praises be,

Precious Savior, unto Thee!

4.  Heart-felt praise and adoration,

Savior, thus to Thee we give:

For Thy life’s humiliation,

For Thy death, whereby we live;

All the grief Thou wert enduring,

All the bliss Thou wert securing,

Evermore the theme shall be,

Of thanksgivings, Lord, to Thee.
