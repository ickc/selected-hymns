# 616 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  “Forward!” be our watchword, Steps and voices joined;\
Seek the things before us, Not a look behind;\
‘Burns the fiery pillar At our army’s head;\
Who shall dream of shrinking, By our Captain led?\
Forward through the desert, Through the toil and fight;\
Heaven’s Kingdom waits us, Forward into light.

2.  Glories upon glories Hath our God prepared,\
By the souls that love Him, One day to be shared:\
Eye hath not beheld them, Ear hath never heard;\
Nor of these hath uttered Thought or speech or word;\
Forward, marching forward Where the kingdom’s bright,\
Till the veil be lifted, Till our faith be sight!
