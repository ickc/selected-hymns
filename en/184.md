# 184 8.8.8.8.

1.  The Holy Spirit is the seal,

The foretaste, earnest, and the pledge.

He designates us as God’s own

And guarantees our heritage.

2.  ’Twas after we believed in Christ,\
The word of truth, the gospel, heard,

The Holy Spirit us did seal\
To show that we belong to God.

3.  This Spirit as the living seal,

To us God’s image now imparts;

Conforming us unto the Son,

He stamps His image in our hearts.

4.  This Spirit also is the pledge,

Our earnest and our foretaste true.

He witnesses that we are sons,

With God’s inheritance in view.

5.  ’Tis by this Spirit God does spread

Into our mind, emotion, will;

By sealing every inward part,

He will our very being fill.

6.  Oh Lord, we would cooperate\
With all Thy Spirit’s inward move;\
That we become Thy masterpiece,\
Th’eternal purpose thus to prove.
