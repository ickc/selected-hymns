# 816 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  If I'd know Christ's risen power.

I must ever love the Cross;

Life from death alone arises;

There's no gain except by loss.

If no death, no life,

If no death, no life;

Life from death alone arises;

If no death, no life.

2.  If I'd have Christ formed within me.

I must breathe my final breath,

Live within the Cross's shadow,

Put my soul-life e'er to death.

3.  If God thru th' Eternal Spirit

Nail me ever with the Lord;

Only then as death is working

Will His life thru me be poured.
