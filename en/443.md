# 443 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  No mortal tongue can e’er describe

The freedom of the soul,

When passed beyond all earthly bribe

To God’s complete control.

All things are his, yes, life, and death,

Things present or to come;

In Christ he draws in peace each breath,

In Christ he finds his home.

2.  When such as we the King can choose,

To share with Him His throne,

’Tis passing strange that we refuse

To be our Lord’s alone.

O never speak of sacrifice!

A privilege untold

Is to be His at any price,

In Calv’ry’s hosts enrolled.

3.  Arise! the holy bargain strike—

The fragment for the whole—

All men and all events alike

Must serve the ransomed soul.

All things are yours when you are His,

And He and you are one;

A boundless life in Him there is,

Whence doubt and fear are gone.
