# 690 8.8.8.7.

1.  I’ve tried in vain a thousand ways

My fears to quell, my hopes to raise;

But what I need, the Bible says,

Is ever, only Jesus.

2.  My soul is night, my heart is steel—

I cannot see, I cannot feel;

For light, for life I must appeal

In simple faith to Jesus.

3.  He died, He lives, He reigns, He pleads;

There’s love in all His words and deeds;

There’s all a guilty sinner needs

Forevermore in Jesus.

4.  Though some should sneer, and some should blame,

I’ll go with all my guilt and shame;

I’ll go to Him because His name,

Above all names, is Jesus.
