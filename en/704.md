# 704 6.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  I hear Thy welcome voice,

That calls me, Lord, to Thee,

For cleansing in Thy precious blood

That flowed on Calvary.

I am coming, Lord,

Coming now to Thee:

Wash me, cleanse me in the blood

That flowed on Calvary.

2.  Though coming weak and vile,

Thou dost my strength assure;

Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,

Till spotless all, and pure.

3.  â€™Tis Jesus who confirms

The blessed work within,

By adding grace to welcomed grace,

Where reigned the power of sin.

4.  And He the witness gives

To loyal hearts and free,

That every promise is fulfilled,

If faith but brings the plea.

5.  All hail, redeeming blood!

All hail, life-giving grace!

All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,

Our strength and righteousness.
