1.  I have a Friend, whose faithful love

Is more than all the world to me:

‘Tis higher than the heights above,

And deeper than the soundless sea;

So old, so new, So strong, so true;

Before the earth received its frame,

He loved me—Blessed be His name!

2.  He held the highest place above,

Adored by all the sons of flame,

Yet such His self-denying love,

He laid aside His crown and came

To seek the lost, And at the cost

Of heavenly rank and earthly fame

He sought me—Blessed be His name!

3.  It was a lonely path He trod,

From every human soul apart;

Known only to Himself and God

Was all the grief that filled His heart,

Yet from the track He turned not back

Till where I lay in want and shame,

He found me—Blessed be His name!

4.  Then dawned at last that day of dread,

When desolate, yet undismayed,

With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,

He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,

Was then made sin On Calvary,

And, dying there in grief and shame,

He saved me—Blessed be His name!

5.  Long as I live my song shall tell

The wonders of His dying love;

And when at last I go to dwell

In that bright home with Him above,

My joy shall be His face to see,

And bowing there with loud acclaim

I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!
