1.  Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,

Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;

Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,

None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.^[Meaning, married (Isa, 62:4.)]

I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,

I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;

O yes, I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,

For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

2.  Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,

Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;

Safe am I within the castle of God’s word retreating,

Nothing then can reach me, ’tis Beulah Land.

3.  Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,

I am safely sheltered here, protected by God’s hand;

Here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me,

I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

4.  Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,

Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;

Dwelling in the spirit, here I learn of full salvation,

Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
