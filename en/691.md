# 691 11.8.11.8. with chorus

1.  The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;

The light of the world is Jesus;

Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,

The light of the world is Jesus.

Come to the light, â€™tis shining for thee;

Sweetly the light has dawned upon me;

Once I was blind, but now I can see;

The light of the world is Jesus.

2.  No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,

The light of the world is Jesus;

We walk in the light when we follow our Guide,

The light of the world is Jesus.

3.  Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,

The light of the world is Jesus;

Go, wash, at His bidding, and light will arise;

The light of the world is Jesus.
