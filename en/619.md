# 619 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  I dare not be defeated With Calvary in view,

Where Jesus conquered Satan, Where all His foes He slew;

Come, Lord, and give the vision To nerve me for the fight,

Make me an overcomer Clothed with Thy Spirit’s might.

A victor, a victor! Because of Calvary.

Make me an overcomer, A conqu’ror, a conqu’ror, Lord, in Thee.

2.  I dare not be defeated Since Christ, my conquering King

Has called me to the battle Which He did surely win.

Come, Lord, and give me courage, Thy conquering Spirit give,

Make me an overcomer, In power within me live.

3.  I dare not be defeated, When Jesus leads me on

To press through hellish regions To share with Him His Throne;

Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier The power to wield the sword,

Make me an overcomer Through Thine inerrant Word.

4.  I dare not be defeated, Just at the set of sun,

When Jesus waits to whisper, “Well done, beloved, well done”;

Come, Lord, bend from the Glory, On me Thy Spirit cast,

Make me an overcomer, A victor to the last.
