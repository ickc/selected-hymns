# 216 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  All heaven waits with bated breath,

For saints on earth to pray.

Majestic angels ready stand

With swords of fiery blade.

Astounding power awaits a word,

From God’s resplendent throne

But God awaits our prayer of faith

That cries “Your will be done.”

2.  Awake, O church, Arise and pray,

Complaining words discard.

The Spirit comes to fill your mouth

With truth, His mighty sword.

Go place your feet on Satan’s ground

And there proclaim Christ’s name,

In step with heaven’s armies march

To conquer and to reign!

3.  Now in our hearts and on our lips

The word of faith is near;

Let heaven’s will on earth be done,

Let heaven flow from here.

Come blend your prayers with Jesus’ own

Before the Father’s throne;

And as the incense clouds ascend

God’s holy fire rains down.

4.  Soon comes the day when with a shout

King Jesus shall appear,

And with Him all the church

From every age shall fill the air.

The brightness of His coming shall

Consume the lawless one;

As with a word the breath of God

Tears down his rebel throne.

5.  One body here by heav’n inspired,

We seek prophetic power.

In Christ agreed one heart and voice

To speak this day and hour.

In every place where chaos rules

And evil forces brood;

Let Jesus voice speak like the roar

Of a great multitude.
