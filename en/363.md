1.  I need Jesus, my need I now confess;

No friend like Him in times of deep distress;

I need Jesus, the need I gladly own;

Tho’ some may bear their load alone,

Yet I need Jesus.

I need Jesus, I need Jesus,

I need Jesus ev’ry day;

Need Him in the sunshine hour,

Need Him when the storm-clouds low’r;

Every day a long my way,

Yes, I need Jesus.

2.  I need Jesus, I need a friend like Him,

A friend to guide when paths of life are dim;

I need Jesus, when foes my soul assail;

Alone I know I can but fail,

So I need Jesus.

3.  I need Jesus, I need Him to the end;

No one like Him, He is the sinner’s friend;

I need Jesus, no other friend will do;

So constant, kind, so strong and tree,

Yes, I need Jesus.
