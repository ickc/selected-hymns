1.  Praise Him forevermore,

Praise ye the Savior’s grace.

To Him who gave His life,

All glory, thanks and praise.

Behold! God’s Son on Calvary

Was crucified for you and me.

2.  His love is far beyond

All friends’ or parents’ love,

Let’s sing and praise His love

From earh to heav’n above.

Behold! God’s Son on Calvary

Was crucified for you and me.

3.  Destroyed is Satan’s power—

How blessed is our state!

Who can make us depart

From God’s own love so great?

Behold! God’s Son on Calvary

Was crucified for you and me.
