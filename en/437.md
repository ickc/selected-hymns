1.  Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,

Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;

Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,

Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!

Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!

Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!

Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!

2.  Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,

Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;

With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,

Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near.

3.  Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,

Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep;

He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,

Up to where they gather in the rest of God.
