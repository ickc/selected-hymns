# 698 10.8.10.8. with chorus

1.  If you are tired of the load of your sin,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

If you desire a new life to begin,

Let Jesus come into your heart.

Just now, your doubtings give o’er;

Just now, reject Him no more;

Just now, throw open the door;

Let Jesus come into your heart.

2.  If ’tis for purity now that you sigh,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,

Let Jesus come into your heart.

3.  If there’s a tempest your voice cannot still,

Let Jesus come into your heart;

If there’s a void this world never can fill,

Let Jesus come into your heart.
