# 725 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,

To tell to all the world that God is Light,

That He who made all nations is not willing

One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;

Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

2.  Behold how many thousands still are lying,

Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,

With none to tell them of the Savior’s dying

Or of the life He died for them to win.

3.  ’Tis yours to save from peril of perdition

The soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;

Beware lest, slothful to fulfill your mission,

You lose one jewel that should deck His crown.

4.  Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation

That God, in whom they move and live, is love;

Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,

And died on earth that men He might approve.

5.  Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;

Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;

Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,

And all you spend our Savior will repay.

6.  He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,

Make known to every heart His saving grace;

Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,

Through your neglect unfit to see His face.
