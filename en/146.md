# 146 8.6.8.6.

1.  O for a thousand tongues to sing

My great Redeemer’s praise,

The glories of my God and King,

The triumphs of His grace.

2.  My gracious Master and my God,

Assist me to proclaim,

To spread through all the earth abroad,

The honors of Thy name.

3.  Jesus! the name that charms our fears,

That bids our sorrows cease;

’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,

’Tis life, and health, and peace.

4.  His love my heart has captive made,

His captive would I be,

For He was bound, and scourged and died,

My captive soul to free.

5.  He breaks the power of canceled sin,

He sets the prisoner free;

His blood can make the foulest clean;

His blood availed for me.

6.  So now Thy blessed Name I love,

Thy will would e’er be mine.

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

My Lord, they all were Thine!
