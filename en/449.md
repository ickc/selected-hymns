# 449 10.10.10.10.D.

1.  Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;

Living with Jesus a new life divine;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,

Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Moment by moment I’m kept in His love,

Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;

Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

2.  Never a battle with wrong for the right,

Never a contest that He doth not fight;

Lifting above us His banner so white;

Moment by moment I’m kept in His sight.

3.  Never a trial that He is not there,

Never a burden that He doth not bear;

Never a sorrow that He doth not share,

Moment by moment, I’m under His care.

4.  Never a heartache, and never a groan,

Never a teardrop, and never a moan;

Never a danger but there on the throne

Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

5.  Never a weakness that He doth not feel,\
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;\
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,\
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
