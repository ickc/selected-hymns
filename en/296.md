# 296 6.6.6.6. with chorus

1.  My hope is in the Lord

Who gave Himself for me,

And paid the price of all

My sin at Calvary.

For me He died,

For me He lives,

And everlasting life and light

He freely gives.

2.  No merit of my own

His anger to suppress,

My only hope is found

In Jesus’ righteousness.

3.  And now for me He stands

Before the Father’s throne,

He shows His wounded hands,

And names me as His own.

4.  His grace has planned it all;

’Tis mine but to believe,

And recognize His work

Of love, and Christ receive.
