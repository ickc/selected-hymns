# 392 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,

And all things else recede;

My heart be daily nearer Thee,

From sin be daily freed.

Each day let Thy supporting might

My weakness still embrace;

My darkness vanish in Thy light,

Thy life my death efface.

2.  In Thy bright beams which on me fall,

Fade every evil thought;

That I am nothing, Thou art all,

I would be daily taught.

3.  More of Thy glory let me see,

Thou Holy, Wise, and True;

I would Thy living image be,

In joy and sorrow too.

4.  Fill me with gladness from above,

Hold me by strength divine;

Lord, let the glow of Thy great love

Through all my being shine.

5.  Make this poor self grow less and less,

Be Thou my life and aim;

Oh, make me daily through Thy grace

More meet to bear Thy name.
