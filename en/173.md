# 173 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Joys are flowing like a river,

Since the Comforter has come;

He abides with us forever,

Makes the trusting heart His home.

Blessed quietness, holy quietnessâ€”

What assurance in my soul!

On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.

How the billows cease to roll!

2.  Bringing life and health and gladness

All around, this heavenly Guest

Banished unbelief and sadness,

Changed our weariness to rest.

3.  Like the rain that falls from heaven,

Like the sunlight from the sky,

So the Holy Ghost is given,

Coming to us from on high.

4.  See a fruitful field is growing

Blessed fruits of righteousness,

And the streams of life are flowing

In the lonely wilderness.

5.  What a wonderful salvation

Where we always see His face!

What a perfect habitation!

What a quiet resting place!
