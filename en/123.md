# 123 8.6.8.6. with repeat (Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)

1.  All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name!

Let angels prostrate fall;

Bring forth the royal diadem,

And crown Him Lord of all!

2.  Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,

Ye ransomed from the fall,

Hail Him who saves you by His grace,

And crown Him Lord of all!

3.  Let every kindred, every tribe,

On this terrestrial ball,

To Him all majesty ascribe,

And crown Him Lord of all!

4.  O that with yonder sacred throng

We at His feet may fall!

We’ll join the everlasting song,

And crown Him Lord of all!
