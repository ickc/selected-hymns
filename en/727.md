1.  Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,

Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

Weep o’er the erring one, Lift up the fallen,

Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.

Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying;

Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

2.  Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,

Waiting the penitent child to receive;

Plead with them earnestly, Plead with them gently;

He will forgive if they only believe.

3.  Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter,

Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;

Touched by a loving heart, Wakened by kindness,

Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.

4.  Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it;

Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;

Back to the narrow way. Patiently win them;

Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died.
