1.  In the Overcomer’s Name Be an overcomer too!

Stand and put the foe to shame All the livelong battle through!

2.  Jesus is the Name to sound, Name to rally fainting hearts!

To recapture “forfeit” ground, Lost awhile through Satan’s arts.

3.  Backward drive the Evil One! Force him out of every hold;

Smite until the sinking sun Sets upon the warrior bold!

4.  In the Overcomer’s Name Be an overcomer too!

Stand and put the foe to shame All the livelong battle through!
