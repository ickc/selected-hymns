1.  Lord, teach us how to pray,

Not as the nations do in vain,

But turn us from our way,

And cause us, Lord, to call on You each day—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

2.  Lord, You’re the seed of life;

You’ve sown Yourself into our heart,

And now You have a start;

So day by day more life to us impart—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

3.  Lord Jesus, soften us;

You know the source from which we came.

By calling on Your name,

Lord, let no earth unturned nor rocks remain—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

4.  Lord, how Your light makes clear

That we could not but e’er fail You;

Yet there’s a message true,

The seed of life within us will break through—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

5.  Make us in spirit poor;

Lord, take whate’er we think we know.

We’ll open to life’s flow,

And thus take in the life that makes us grow—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

6.  Lord, make us pure in heart;

For we’ll not be content until

You all our being fill,

O Lord, renew our mind, emotion, will—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

7.  Yes, Lord, impress our heart

That we must take You in each day;

The seed will have its way;

Your growing brings the kingdom here to stay—

Lord Jesus, grow in us.

8.  Amen!—The growth in life!

There’s nothing that Your life can’t do;

Our every part renew.

We’ll make it, we’ll make it just by You.

Lord Jesus, grow in us.^[Repeat last line]
