1.  My faith looks up to Thee,

Thou Lamb of Calvary,

Savior Divine;

Now hear me while I pray;

Take all my guilt away;

Oh, let me from this day

Be wholly Thine.

2.  May Thy rich grace impart\
Strength to my fainting heart,\
My zeal inspire;\
As Thou hast died for me,\
Oh, may my love to Thee\
Pure, warm, and changeless be,\
A living fire.

3.  While life’s dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be Thou my Guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,

Wipe sorrow’s tears away,

Nor let me ever stray

From Thee aside.

4.  When ends life’s transient dream,

When death’s cold, sullen stream,

Shall o’er me roll;

Blest Savior, then, in love,

Fear and distrust remove;

Oh, bear me safe above,

A ransomed soul.
