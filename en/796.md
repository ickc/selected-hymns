# 796 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  If Thou shouldst take my love away,

Give me Thyself, I pray.

If Thou shouldst let me be misjudged,

Give me Thyself today.

Lord Jesus, blessed Savior,

More of Thyself I need.

To Thee I now surrender,

“More of Thyself!” I plead.

2.  If Thou shouldst let my hope be blurred,

Give me Thyself, I pray.

If Thou shouldst let me be disturbed,

Give me Thyself today.

3.  If Thou shouldst take my trust away,

Give me Thyself, I pray.

If Thou shouldst now my pray'r refuse,

Give me Thyself today.

4.  If I should need to more endure,

Still give Thyself, I pray.

If Thy return will be delayed,

I need Thyself today.
