# 527 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Lord, our earnest expectation

Is that Christ be magnified,

And in all our circumstances

Universally applied.

Lord, in nothing will we be ashamed,

Though in suffering, hardship, loss,

But in all things Christ shall be expressed,

Life shall triumph through the cross!

2.  This shall turn to our salvation,

Through the Spirit bountiful

And the prayers of all the members,

For a testimony full.

3.  Lord, we praise You for the pattern

Of a living crucified,

And the Father’s exaltation

Of Yourself so qualified.

4.  O how blest, this living pattern

Now is being wrought in ust

Crucifixion, exaltation—

Our salvation marvelous.

5.  We will work out our salvation

Through the operating God,

Through the willing and the working

Wrought within us by the Lord.

6.  Then we’ll blameless be and guileless,

Shining in the world as light,

In a crooked generation

Holding forth the word of life.

7.  Let us stand firm in one spirit,

Always striving with one soul,

That for Jesus’ testimony

God through us may reach His goal.
