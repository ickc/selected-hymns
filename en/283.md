1.  Come and rejoice with me!

For once my heart was poor,

And I have found a treasury

Of love, a boundless store.

2.  Come and rejoice with me!

I, once so sick at heart,

Have met with One who knows my case,

And knows the healing art.

3.  Come and rejoice with me!

For I was wearied sore,

And I have found a mighty arm

Which holds me evermore.

4.  Come and rejoice with me!

My feet so wide did roam,

One has brought me from afar,

To find in Him my home.

5.  Come and rejoice with me!

For I have found a Friend

Who knows my heartâ€™s most secret depths,

Yet loves me without end.

6.  I knew not of His love;

And He had loved so long,

With love so faithful and so deep,

So tender and so strong.

7.  And now I know it all,

Have heard and known His voice,

And hear it still from day to day.

Can I enough rejoice?
