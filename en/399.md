# 399 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Having seen the world’s fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

Having seen the world’s fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

(This hymn was written shortly after its author;

who had been born blind, gained her sight.)

2.  Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,

I can see in paradise,

But while here on earth His mercy

For my blindness will suffice.

3.  I no more would be delivered

From my thom, but look for grace,

While within the veil His glory

Shineth brightly on my face.

4.  In the deep dark night, His beauty

I by faith, not sight, may trace;

He was ridiculed and hated,

Yet I see His glorious face.

5.  Sun and moonlight far surpassing,

Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread,

Is the glory all transcending

Shining from His thorn-crowned head.
