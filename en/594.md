# 594 10.10.10.10. with chorus

1.  Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;

Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;

Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul,

Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.

God is my hope and God is my joy;

He is the resurrection life I enjoy.

2.  Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;

Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;

Pressed into knowing none to help but God,

Pressed into loving both the staff and rod.

3.  Pressed into liberty where nothing clings,

Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;

Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord,

Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.
