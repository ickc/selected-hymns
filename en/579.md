1.  Be still, my heart! these anxious cares

To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;

They cast dishonor on the Lord,

And contradict His gracious word.

2.  Brought safely by His hand thus far,

Why wilt thou now give place to fear?

How canst thou want if He provide,

Or lose thy way with such a Guide?

3.  When first before His mercy-seat

Thou didst to Him thine all commit;

He gave thee warrant from that hour

To trust His wisdom, love, and power.

4.  Did ever trouble yet befall,

And He refuse to hear thy call?

And has He not His promise passed,

That thou shalt overcome at last?

5.  He who has helped me hitherto

Will help me all my journey through,

And give me daily cause to raise

New Ebenezers to His Praise.

6.  Though rough and thorny be the road,

It leads thee on, apace, to God;

Then count thy present trials small,

For God will make amends for all.
