# 653 9.7.9.7. with chorus

1.  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom’s coming,

And the time will not be long

Before we hail that wedding morning

And lift up the glad new song.

Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,

When the Christ we love shall come:

With vessels filled and lamps all burning

Let us welcome His return.

Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom’s coming

And the time will not be long

Before we hail that wedding morning

And lift up the glad new song.

2.  Oh, let us now redeem each moment,

More the precious oil to buy,

And have our vessels filled with ointment

Ere we hear the midnight cry.

3.  Oh, what a joy it is preparing

For our wedding with the Lord,

E’en in the tribulations sharing

For the bliss of such reward!

4.  Oh, with what rapture and rejoicing

Shall the wedding day begin;

And then a thousand years of dining

At the marriage feast with Him!
