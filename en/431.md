# 431 7.7.7.7.7.7.

1.  When this passing world is done,

When has sunk yon glaring sun,\
When we stand with Christ on high,\
Looking o’er life’s history;\
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,\
Not till then, how much I owe.

2.  When I stand before the throne\
Dressed in beauty not my own,\
When I see Thee as Thou art,\
Love Thee with unsinning heart;\
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,\
Not till then, how much I owe.

3.  E’en on earth, as through a glass\
Darkly, let Thy glory pass;\
Make forgiveness feel so sweet;\
Make Thy Spirit,s help so meet:\
E’en on earth, Lord, make me know\
Something of how much I owe.
