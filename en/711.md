1.  I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,

Trusting only Thee;

Trusting Thee for full salvation,

Great and free.

2.  I am trusting Thee for pardon,

At Thy feet I bow;

For Thy grace and tender mercy,

Trusting now.

3.  I am trusting Thee for cleansing

In the crimson flood;

Trusting Thee to make me holy

By Thy blood.

4.  I am trusting Thee to guide me;

Thou alone shalt lead,

Every day and hour supplying

All my need.

5.  I am trusting Thee for power,

Thine can never fail;

Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me

Must prevail.

6.  I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;

Never let me fall;

I am trusting Thee for ever,

And for all.
