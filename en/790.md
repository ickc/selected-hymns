# 790 8.6.8.6.

1.  A mind at perfect peace with God;

O what a word is this!

A sinner reconciled through blood;

This, this indeed is peace.

2.  By nature and by practice far,

How very far from God;

Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,

Through faith in Jesus' blood.

3.  So nigh, so very nigh to God,

I cannot nearer be;

For in the person of His Son

I am as near as He.

4.  So dear, so very dear to God,

More dear I cannot be;

The love wherewith He loves the Son,

Such is His love to me.

5.  Why should I ever anxious be,

Since such a God is mine?

He watches o'er me night and day,

And tells me ""Mine is thine.""
