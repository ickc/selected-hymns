1.  If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Were my life worth living for a day?

Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort

In the things that soon must pass away?

If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?

Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing

For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

2.  Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,

And a name revered both far and near,

Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,

Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;

If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Who endured the cross and died for me,

Could then all the world afford a refuge,

Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

3.  O what emptiness!—without the Savior

‘Mid the sins and sorrows here below!

And eternity, how dark without Him!

Only night and tears and endless woe!

What, though I might live without the Savior,

When I come to die, how would it be?

O to face the valley’s gloom without Him!

And without Him all eternity!

4.  O the joy of having all in Jesus!

What a balm the broken heart to heal!

Ne’er a sin so great, but He’ll forgive it,

Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!

If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,

Nothing else in all the world beside—

O then everything is mine in Jesus;

For my needs and more He will provide.
