1.  “On toward the goal!” Press on! Alone, yet unafraid;

He cut the path, who beckons thee, On then, and undismayed.

2.  “On toward the goal!” Press on! The eyes that are a flame

Are watching thee, what then are men? What matter praise, or blame?

3.  “On toward the goal!” Press on! Look not behind thee now,

When just ahead lies His “Well done,” And crowns await thy brow.

4.  “On toward the goal!” Press on! Blind, deaf and sometimes dumb

Along the blood-marked, uphill way, Hard after Christ, press on!
