1.  “Man of Sorrows,” what a name

For the Son of God who came

Ruined sinners to reclaim!

Hallelujah! what a Savior!

2.  Bearing shame and scoffing rude,

In my place condemned He stood;

Sealed my pardon with His blood;

Hallelujah! what a Savior!

3.  Guilty, vile, and helpless, we,

Spotless Lamb of God was He;

Full redemption—can it be?

Hallelujah! What a Savior!

4.  Lifted up was He to die,

“It is finished!” was His cry;

Now in heaven exalted high;

Hallelujah! what a Savior!

5.  When He comes, our glorious King,

All his ransomed home to bring,

Then anew this song we’ll sing:

Hallelujah! what a Savior!
