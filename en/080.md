# 080 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Lord, we treasure with affection

All Thy path of sorrow here,

And those closing scenes of anguish

To our hearts Thyself endear.

We will praise Thee! We will praise Thee!

Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!

Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!

Give Thee glory for the life we gain!

2.  Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,

Deeper far than thought can reach;

Grief intense and suff’rings holy,

Far beyond all tongues to teach.

3.  None could follow there, blest Savior,

When redemption’s work was done;

For those suff’rings, deep, unfathomed,

Were, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!

4.  Thou didst measure then sin’s distance,

Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine;

Man-betrayed, by God forsaken;

Thus we learn Thy love divine!
