1.  Saints in Christ! Why thus divided?

Christ is not divided so;

Surely all should be together,

Who the same Redeemer know.

By the same blood-shedding purchased,

Destined to the same bright Home—

Why on earth divided? Jesus

Bids you all together come.

2.  Saints in Christ! break down the barriers

Man has reared on every side,

Make a living Christ the Center—

Gather to the Crucified;

Let not sects and parties longer

Separate the “flock of God”—

Jesus died in one to gather

All the scattered ones abroad.

3.  Saints in Christ! a living union

Flows but from the Living Head;

Saints, alas, are ever making

Union in the flesh instead.

Such a union Scripture knows not,

Such, its pages must disown;

God the Spirit draws to Jesus,

Him exalts and Him alone.

4.  Saints in Christ! O, what a witness

For the Savior we should be

Were we all around Him gathered

In the “Spirit’s unity.”

What a sight for men to look on!

What a truth it would proclaim!

What a glory it would render

To our blessed Savior’s name!

5.  Saints in Christ! soon, soon our Master

Whom we love, from heaven will come;

And with happy shouts of triumph,

Bear us to our blissful home!

Then the Cross exchanged for Glory—

Service, for the bright reward;

Then—oh! blessed hope we shall be

ONE, “for ever with the Lord!”
