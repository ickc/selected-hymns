# 374 6.6.6.6.

1.  I hunger and I thirst;

Jesus, my manna be;

Ye living waters, burst

Out of the rock for me.

2.  Thou bruised and broken Bread,

My lifelong wants supply;

As living souls are fed,

O feed me, or I die.

3.  Thou true life-giving Vine,

Let me Thy sweetness prove;

Renew my life with Thine,

Refresh my soul with love.

4.  For still the desert lies

My thirsting soul before;

O living waters, rise

Within me evermore.
