1.  Ye sleeping souls, awake

From dreams of carnal ease!

Your couch of sloth forsake;

Nor seek the flesh to please;

Far from this land of shadows flee,

And march towards eternity.

2.  Aside each burden lay,

That does your course restrain,

And onward urge your way

From nature, self, and sin;

Prepare the midnight cry to hear,

“The Bridegroom comes, behold Him near!”

3.  Arise, go forth to find

Your true and faithful Lord;

And leaving all behind,

In spirit hear His word.

The pure in heart His presence feel,

’Tis them He doth Himself reveal.

4.  Within your souls retired,

His precious love enjoy;

And with His Spirit tlr’d,

Your time in prayer employ;

And purchase oil, whilst yet you may,

Lest it should fail you on that day.

5.  Give God alone Thy heart,

For vain is all disguise.

O Lord Thy love impart,

The oil that makes us wise!

To light our souls with holy fire,

Which shall not, e’en in death, expire.

6.  Jesus, Thyself excite

Our feet to run the race—

To watch, and pray, and fight,

Till we behold Thy face!

Nor let us ever tire, nor rest,

Till with Thy full possession blest!
