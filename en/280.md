1.  He healeth me, oh, bless His name!

I want to spread abroad His fame;

From dread disease He sets me free,

The Lord my healer, strong is He!

He healeth me, He healeth me!

By power divine He healeth me;

He healed the sick in Galilee,

And now by faith He healeth me!

2.  He healeth me! my simple faith

Believes the word that Jesus saith,

And takes the place of ardent hope,

Believes the Lord will raise me up.

3.  He healeth me! I touch for cure

The border of His garment pure,

And virtue through my being flows,

A healing balm for nature’s woes.

4.  He healeth me, as when of yore,

Their sins and sicknesses He bore:

Nor has He lost His power and skill

Our blessed Christ is living still.

5.  He healeth me! how oft I sought

This healing power, but found it not:

But now I trust with all my soul,

And now thro’ faith He makes me whole.
