1.  Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne;

Hark! How the heav’nly anthem drowns

All music but its own!

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of him who died for thee;

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Through all eternity.

2.  Crown Him the Lord of love!

Behold His hands and side,

Rich wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified;

No angel in the sky

Can fully bear that sight,

But downward bends his wond’ring eye

At mysteries so bright.

3.  Crown Him the Lord of life!

Who triumphed o’er the grave;

Who rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save;

His glories now we sing,

Who died and rose on high;

Who died etemal life to bring,

And lives that death may die.

4.  Crown Him the Lord of Heav’n!

One with the Father known,

One with the Spirit through Him giv’n

From yonder glorious throne!

To Thee be endless praise,

For Thou for us hast died;

Be Thou, O Lord, thro’ endless days

Adored and magnified.
