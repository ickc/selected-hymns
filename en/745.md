When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,

We were like them that dream,

We were like them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter,

And our tongue with singing:

Then said they among the nations,

The Lord hath done great things,

The Lord hath done great things for them.

The Lord hath done great things for us;

Whereof we are glad.

The Lord hath done great things for us;

Whereof we are glad.
