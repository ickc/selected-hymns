1.  Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me

A living, bright reality,

More present to faith’s vision keen

Than any earthly object seen;

More dear, more intimately nigh

Than e’en the closest earthly tie.

2.  And Thou, blest vision of my soul,

Hast made my broken nature whole;

Hast purified my base desires,

And kindled passion’s holiest fires;

My nature Thou hast lifted up,

And filled me with a glorious hope.

3.  Nearer and dearer still to me,

Thou living, loving Savior be;

Brighter the vision of Thy face,

More charming still Thy words of grace;

So, life shall be transformed to love,

Thy grace and mercy more to prove.
