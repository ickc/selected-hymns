# 057 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds

In a believer’s ear!

It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,

And drives away his fear.

2.  It makes the wounded spirit whole,

And calms the troubled breast;

’Tis manna to the hungry soul,

And to the weary rest.

3.  Dear Name! the rock on which we build;

Our shield and hiding-place;

Our never-failing treasury, filled

With boundless stores of grace.

4.  Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,

Our Prophet, Priest, and King;

Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,

Accept the praise we bring.

5.  Weak is the effort of our heart,

And cold our warmest thought;

But when we see Thee as Thou art,

We’ll praise Thee as we ought.

6.  Till then we would Thy love proclaim

With every fleeting breath;

And triumph in that blessed Name

Which quells the pow’r of death.
