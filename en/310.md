# 310 10.10.9.9. with chorus

1.  Naught have I gotten but what I received;

Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;

Boasting excluded, pride I abase;

I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

Only a sinner saved by grace!

Only a sinner saved by grace!

This is my story, to God be the glory,

I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

2.  Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,

Causing my footsteps from God to depart;

Jesus hath found me, happy my case;

I now am a sinner saved by grace!

3.  Tears unavailing, no merit had I;

Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;

Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face;

But now I’m a sinner saved by grace!

4.  Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,

Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;

Once more to tell it, would I embrace—

I’m only a sinner saved by grace!
