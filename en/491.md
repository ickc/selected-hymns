# 491 13.10.13.14. with chorus

1.  In God’s green pastures feeding, by His cool waters lie;

Soft, in the evening walk my Lord and I.

All the sheep of His pastures fare so wondrously fine,

His sheep am I .

Waters cool, pastures green,

In the evening walk my Lord and I.

Dark the night,

Rough the way,

Step by step

my Lord and I.

2.  Yes, the Lord is my Shepherd and no want shall I know;

He’ll guide and comfort me where’er I go.

On the mount, in the valley by His hand He will lead,

His sheep am I.
