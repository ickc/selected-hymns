# 369 10.10.10.10.

1.  Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;\
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!\
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,\
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

2.  Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;\
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;\
Change and decay in all around I see;\
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

3.  Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;

But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:\
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;\
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

4.  I need Thy presence every passing hour:

What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?

Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?

Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.

5.  I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:\
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:\
Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?\
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
