# 331 8.6.8.6.

1.  I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,

Or to defend His cause,

Maintain the honor of His Word,

The glory of His cross.

2.  Jesus, my God! I know His name,

His Name is all my trust;

Nor will He put my soul to shame,

Nor let my hope be lost.

3.  Firm as His throne His promise stands,

And He can well secure

What I’ ve committed to His hands,

Till the decisive hour.

4.  Then will He own my worthless name

Before His Father’s face;

And, in the New Jerusalem,

Appoint my soul a place.
