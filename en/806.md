1.  He is most dear to me,

The loveliest of all;

One whom my soul does seek,

On whom I ever call.

2.  He is my aid, in need,

My help, in helpless hours;

Most precious at all times,

Most faithful at all hours.

3.  He is my endless joy,

Changeless as years go by;

He is most dear to me,

No greater love have I.
