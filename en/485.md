# 485 8.6.8.6.

1.  I’ve found the One of peerless worth,

My heart doth sing for joy;

And sing I must, for Christ I have:

Oh, what a Christ have I!

2.  Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;

My Prophet full of light;

My Priest that stands ‘twixt me and God,

My King that rules with might.

3.  My Christ, He is the Lord of lords,

He is the King of kings;

He is the Sun of Righteousness,

With healing in His wings.

4.  Christ is my meat, Christ is my drink,

My medicine and my health;

My peace, my strength, my joy, my crown,

My glory and my wealth.

5.  Christ is my Father, and my Friend,

My Brother, and my Love;

My Head, my Hope, my Counsellor,

My Advocate above.

6.  My Christ, He is the Heaven of heavens;

My Christ what shall I call?

My Christ is First, my Christ is Last,

My Christ is All in all.
