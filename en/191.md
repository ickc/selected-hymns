# 191 8.8.8.8.

1.  In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst

At Calv’ry’s cross once come to rest;

Yet Thou art working still today,

But in another form expressed.

2.  Thy saving pow’r Thou still dost show;

Thou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;

Thou and the Spirit in one stream

Sweep many in Thy living tide.

3.  Through Him Thy power’s not witheld;

Through Him Thy working does not cease;

Thou still dost comfort and command,

Encourage, strengthen, and release.

4.  Since Thou art with the Spirit one

His coming means that Thou hast come,

And His indwelling is Thine own,

Since Thou the Spirit hast become.

5.  He executes within my heart

All Thy desires and Thy demands,

As for the Father here on earth

Thou hast performed all His commands.

6.  By knowing Him we know Thyself;

Obeying Him we Thee obey;

Allowing Him ourselves to fill,

We’re filled with Thee, O wondrous way!

7.  Thou art not far away in heav’n,

Leaving us here alone, apart;

But Thou art still on earth; how grand!

Thou livest right within my heart.
