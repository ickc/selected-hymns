1.  My glorious Victor, Prince Divine,\
Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine;\
At length my will is all Thine own,\
Glad vassal of a Savior’s throne.

2.  My Master, lead me to Thy door;

Pierce this now willing ear once more;\
Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay\
With Thee, to toil, endure, obey.

3.  Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will,

Use all in Thy dear slav’ry still!

Self’s weary liberties I cast

Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast.

4.  Tread them still down; and then I know,\
These hands shall with Thy gifts o’erfiow;\
And pierced ears shall hear the tone\
Which tells me Thou and I are one.
