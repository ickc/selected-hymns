1.  Fairest Lord Jesus!

Ruler of all nature!

O Thou of God and man the Son!

Thee will I cherish,

Thee will I honor,

Thou, my soul’s glory, joy and crown!

2.  Fair are the meadows,

Fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring;

Jesus is fairer,

Jesus is purer,

Who makes the woeful heart to sing!

3.  Fair is the sunshine,

Fairer still the moonlight,

And all the twinkling starry host;

Jesus shines brighter,

Jesus shines purer,

Than all the angels heav’n can boast!

4.  All fairest beauty,

Heavenly and earthly,

Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;

None can be nearer,

Fairer, or dearer,

Than Thou my Savior art to me.
