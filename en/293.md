# 293 10. 10. 10. 12. with chorus

1.  Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;

Now through the blood I’m saved from all alarms;

Down at the cross my heart is bend-ing low;

The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.

I love Him, I love Him,

Because He first loved me,

And purchased my salvation on Calvary’s tree.

2.  Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;

Once was a slave to passions fierce within;

Once was afraid to meet an angry God,

But now I’m cleansed from every stain thro’ Jesus’ blood.

3.  Once I was bound, but now I am set free;

Once I was blind, but now the light I see;

Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,

To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.
