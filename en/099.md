1.  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son,

Endless is the vict’ry Thou o’er death hast won;

Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,

Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay.

Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son,

Endless is the vict’ry thou o’er death hast won.

2.  Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;

Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;

Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,

For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.

3.  No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of Life!

Life is nought without Thee; aid us in our strife;

Make us more than conjurors, through Thy deathless

love;

May we in Thy Kingdom reign with Thee above.
