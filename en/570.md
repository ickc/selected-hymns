1.  Be not dismayed whate’er betide,

> God will take care of you!

Beneath His wings of love abide,

God will take care of you!

God will take care of you,

Through every day o’er all the way;

He will take care of you;

God will take care of you!

2.  Through days of toil when heart doth fail,

God will take care of you!

When dangers fierce your path assail,

God will take care of you!

3.  All you may need He will provide,

God will take care of you!

Trust Him, and you will be satisfied,

God will take care of you!

4.  Lonely and sad, from friends apart,

God will take care of you!

He will give peace to your aching heart,

God will take care of you!

5.  No matter what may be the test,

God will take care of you!

Lean, weary one, upon His breast,

God will take care of you!
