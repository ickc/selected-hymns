# 681 10.9.10.8. with chorus

1.  Would you be free from your burden of sin?

There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;

Would you o’er evil a victory win?

There’s wonderful power in the blood.

There is power, power, wonder-working power,

In the blood of the Lamb;

There is power, power, wonder-working power,

In the precious blood of the Lamb.

2.  Would you be free from your passion and pride?

There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;

for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide,

There’s wonderful power in the blood.

3.  Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?

There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;

Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow,

There’s wonderful power in the blood.

4.  Would you do service for Jesus your. King?

There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;

Would you live daily His praises to sing?

There’s wonderful power in the blood.
