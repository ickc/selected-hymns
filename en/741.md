Lord, I am continually with Thee:

Thou hast holden me by my right hand,

Thou shalt guide me,

Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel,

And afterward receive me,

Receive me to glory.

Whom have I in heaven but Thee?

And there is none upon the earth

That I desire beside Thee.

My flesh and my heart faileth;

But God is the strength of my heart,

And my portion forever.
