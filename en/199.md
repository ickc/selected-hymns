# 199 8.8.9.8. with chorus

1.  Open my eyes that I may see

Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;

Place in my hands the wonderful key

That shall unclasp and set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

Open my eyes, illumine me,

Spirit Divine!

2.  Open my ears that I may hear

Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;

And while the wave notes fall on my ear,

Everything false will disappear.

3.  Open my mouth and let me bear

Tidings of mercy everywhere;

Open my hert and let me prepare

Love with Thy children thus to share.

4.  Open my mind that I may read

More of Thy love in word and deed;

What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?

Only for light from Thee I plead.
