# 420 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  How vast, immense, and measureless,

The love of Christ to

How else could such a wretch as I

Be blessed so wondrously?

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  To bring me back unto Himself,

My Lord His all did spend;

So I would gladly bear the cross

And follow to the end.

3.  My all I have forsaken now,

This blessed Christ to gain;

Now life or death is no concern—

What else can me restrain?

4.  My dear ones, wealth, ambition, fame—

What can they offer me?

My gracious Lord for me was poor;

For Him I poor would be.

5.  My precious Savior now I love,

His smile I would obtain.

For Him, let gain be turned to loss

And comfort turned to pain.

6.  Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord!

I’ve none in heav’n but Thee.

And who but Thee is there on earth

With whom I love to be?

7.  Though loneliness and hardships come,

My soul can rise above.

This only would I ask Thee, Lord:

Enfold me in Thy love!

8.  O gracious Lord, I now beseech,

Guide me through every stage;

Stand by and strengthen me to go

Through this dark, evil age.

9.  The world, the flesh, and Satan too,

Do tempt my soul apace;

Without Thy love and strength’ning power

I may Thy name disgrace.

10.  The time, dear Lord, is short indeed;

From earth my soul set free.

When Thou dost come, I’ll sing with joy,

Hallelujah, Lord, to Thee!
