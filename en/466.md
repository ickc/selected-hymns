# 466 6.6.6.6.8.6.

1.  Once I was dead in sin,

And hope within me died;

But now I’m dead to sin,

With Christ I’m crucified.

And can it be that “He loved me,

And gave Himself for me”?

2.  O height I cannot reach!

O depth I cannot sound!

O love, O boundless love,

In my Redeemer found!

3.  I live—and yet not I,

But Christ that lives in me,

Who from the law of sin

And death has made me free.
