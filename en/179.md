# 179 11.9.11.9. with chorus

1.  Now the Triune God has come to dwell within

As the wonderful Spirit in us.

We are mingled with the Lord, we’re one with Him

As the life-giving Spirit in us.

Oh, He’s the wonderful Spirit in us,

He’s the wonderful Spirit in us!

God is in the Son, the Son’s the Spirit now—

He’s the wonderful Spirit in us!

2.  ""Abba Father” is the cry from deep within

From the wonderful Spirit in us.

’Tis the Spirit of the Son who cries to Him

As the life-giving Spirit in us.

3.  Jesus Christ the Lord is living now in us

As the wonderful Spirit within.

He has been transfigured, we enjoy Him thus,

As the life-giving Spirit within.

4.  Now the Spirit of reality is here

As the wonderful Spirit within.

Now the things of Christ are all so real and clear

By the life-giving Spirit within.

5.  We will all stir up this gift that’s deep within

As the wonderful Spirit in us.

When we call “Lord Jesus” how our spirits spring

With this life-giving Spirit in us!
