# 329 9.7.10.7. with chorus

1.  I have a song that Jesus gave me,

It was sent from heav’n above;

There never was a sweeter melody,

’Tis a melody of love.

In my heart there rings a melody,

There rings a melody with heaven’s harmony;

In my heart there rings a melody;

There rings a melody of love.

2.  I love the Christ who died on Calv’ry,

For He washed my sins away;

He put within my heart a melody,

And I know it’s there to stay.

3.  ‘Twill be my endless theme in glory,

With the angels I will sing;

‘Twill be a song with glorious harmony,

When the courts of heaven ring.
