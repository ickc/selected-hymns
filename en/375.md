# 375 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Savior, lead me up the mountain,

Where the Lord alone is seen,

Where we hear the voice from heaven,

Where the air is pure and clean.

Lead me higher up the mountain,

Give me fellowship with Thee;

In Thy light I see the fountain,

And the blood it cleanses me.

2.  Higher up where light increases,\
Far above all earthly strife,\
Where the strain of effort ceases,\
Where in Christ we reign in Life.

3.  Savior, keep me up the mountain

Pressing on toward the goal,

Till, as one, we share Thine image,

And Thy love and grace extol.
