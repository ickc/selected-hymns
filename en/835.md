# 835 15.11.15.7. with chorus

1.  When the toils of life are over,

and we lay our armor down,

And we bid farewell to earth with all its cares,

We shall meet and greet our loved ones,

and our Christ we then shall crown

In the new Jerusalem.

There’ll be singing, there’ll be shouting,

when the saints come marching home,

In Jerusalem, in Jerusalem;

Waving palms with loud hosanas,

as the King shall take His throne,

In the new Jerusalem.

2.  Though the way is sometimes lonely,

He will hold me with His hand,

Through the testings and the trials I must go;

But I’ll trust and gladly follow,

for sometime I’ll understand,

In the new Jerusalem.

3.  When the last good-bye is spoken,

and the tear stains wiped away,

And our eyes shall catch a glimpse of glory fair,

Then with bounding hearts we'll meet Him

who hath washed our sins away,

In the new Jerusalem.

4.  When we join the ransomed army

in the summerland above,

And the face of our dear

Saviour we behold,

We will sing and shout forever

and we'll grow in perfect love,

In the new Jerusalem.
