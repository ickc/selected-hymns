# 147 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  Jesus, wondrous Savior!

Christ, of kings the King!

Angels fall before Thee,

Prostrate, worshipping;

Fairest they confess Thee

In the heav’n above.

We would sing Thee fairest

Here in hymns of love.

2.  All earth’s flowing pleasures

Were a wintry sea;

Heav’n itself without Thee

Dark as night would be.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the light above.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the life of love.

3.  Life is death, if severed

From Thy throbbing heart.

Death with life abundant

At Thy touch would start.

Worlds and men and angels

All consist in Thee,

Yet Thou earnest to us

In humility.

4.  Jesus! all perfections

Rise and end in Thee;

Brightness of God’s glory

Thou, eternally.

Favored beyond measure

They Thy face who see;

May we, gracious Savior,

Share this ecstasy.
