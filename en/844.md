# 844 10.7.10.7. with chorus

1.  Jesus lingers still: ‘tis for you He waits,

And He’s waiting for you long;

He waits that heaven, with its fadeless joys,

May yet to you belong.

Come, and welcome, whosoever will,

‘Tis the Savior’s gracious call;

He is able, willing , waiting now to save,

Simply trust Him, that is all.

2.  Though your wayward feet may have wandered far,

And you're deeply sunk in sin;

Yet the Savior waits, with His patient grace

Your stony heart to win.

3.  Though His gracious call you have oft refused

And He's sought your trust in vain;

Yet, with love unchanged by your cold neglect

He is seeking you again.

4.  Oh, surrender now! yield to love divine;

Jesus lingers for you still:

While in grace He says, ""Oh, come to Me,""

Let your answer be, ""I will.""
