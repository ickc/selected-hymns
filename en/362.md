1.  My goal is God Him self, not joy, nor peace,

Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;

â€™Tis His to lead me there not mine, but His

At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.

2.  So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,

And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;

Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard

Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.

3.  No matter if the way be sometimes dark,

No matter though the cost be oft-times great,

He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,

The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.

4.  One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;

One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;

My God my glory here, from day to day,

And in the glory there my great Reward.
