# 186 7.7.7.7. with chorus

1.  “Seven Spirits” of our God—

See, the age has now been turned

To the Spirit with the Son.

For the churches He’s concerned.

Come, O seven Spirits, come

Thy recovery work be done!

Burn and search us thoroughly,

All the churches are for Thee.

Burn us, search us,

All the churches are for Thee!

2.  Sevenfold the Spirit is

For the deadness of the church,

That the saints may turn and live,

That the Lord may burn and search.

3.  Now the Spirit of our God

Has become intensified:

’Tis not one but sevenfold

That the church may be supplied!

4.  Now the seven Spirits are

Seven lamps of burning fire,

Not to teach us, but to burn,

Satisfying God’s desire.

5.  See the seven Spirits now

Seven piercing, searching eyes.

In the church exposing us,

All the church He purifies.

6.  Seven Spirits doth the Lord

For the churches now employ;

All the churches of the Lord

May this Spirit now enjoy.
