1.  Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,

Nor creed, nor form, nor word,

Nor holy Church, nor human love,

Compare with Thee, my Lord!

2.  Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,

Thy love has conquered me;

Beneath Thy Cross I die to self,

And live alone to Thee.

3.  Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,

My inmost being fill;

So shall I think as Thou dost think,

And will as Thou dost will.

4.  Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,

Thy life transfigure mine;

And through this veil of mortal flesh,

Lord, let Thy splendor shine.

5.  Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,

My soul exults in Thee;

To be Thy slave, to do Thy will,

Is my felicity.
