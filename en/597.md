# 597 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  In the heart of Jesus There is love for you,

Love most pure and tender, Love most deep and true;

Why should you be lonely, Why for friendship sigh,

When the heart of Jesus Has a full supply?

2.  In the mind of Jesus There is thought for you,

Warm as summer sunshine, Sweet as morning dew;

Why should you be fearful, Why take anxious thought,

Since the mind of Jesus Cares for those He bought?

3.  In the field of Jesus There is work for you;

Such as even angels Might rejoice to do;

Why stand idly sighing For some life-work grand,

While the field of Jesus Seeks your reaping hand?

4.  In the Church of Jesus There’s a place for you;

Glorious, bright, and joyous, Right and peaceful too;

Why then, like a wand’rer, Roam with weary pace,

If the Church of Jesus Holds for you a place?
