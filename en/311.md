# 311 6.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  Grace! ’tis a charming sound,

Harmonious to the ear;

Heav’n with the echo shall resound,

And all the earth shall hear.

All sufficient grace!

Never powerless!

It is Christ who lives in me,

In His exhaustlessness.

2.  ’Twas grace that wrote my name

In life’s eternal book;

’Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,

Who all my sorrows took.

3.  Grace taught my wandering feet

To tread the pilgrim road;

And new supplies each hour I meet

While pressing on to God.

4.  Grace taught my heart to pray,

And made my eyes o’erflow;

’Tis grace which kept me to this day,

And will not let me go.

5.  Grace all the work shall crown

Through everlasting days;

It lays in love the topmost stone,

And well deserves the praise.

6.  Oh, let that grace inspire

My heart with strength divine;

May all my powers to Thee aspire,

And all my days be Thine.
