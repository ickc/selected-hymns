# 396 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  More holiness give me, More sweetness within,

More patience in suff’ring, More sorrow for sin,

More faith in my Savior, More sense of His care,

More joy in His service, More freedom in prayer.

Come, my Savior, and help me, Comfort, strengthen and keep me;

Thou each moment wilt save me, Thou art saving me now.

2.  More gratitude give me, More trust in the Lord,

More zeal for His glory, More hope in His Word,

More tears for His sorrows, More pain at His grief,

More meekness in trial, More praise for relief.

3.  More victory give me, More strength to o’ercome,

More freedom from earth-stains, More quest for the throne,

More fit for the kingdom, More useful I’d be,

More blessed and holy, More, Savior, like Thee.
