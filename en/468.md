1.  Once far from God and dead in sin,

No light my heart could see;

But in God’s Word the light I found,

Now Christ liveth in me.

Christ liveth in me,

Christ liveth in me;

Oh! what a salvation this,

That Christ liveth in me.

2.  As rays of light from yonder sun,

The flow’rs of earth set free,

So life and light and love come forth

From Christ living in me.

3.  As lives the flow’r within the seed,

As in the cone the tree,

So, praise the Christ of truth and grace,

His Spirit dwelleth in me.

4.  With longing all my heart is filled,

That like Him I may be,

As on the wondrous thought I dwell

That Christ liveth in me.
