# 475 6.5.6.5.D. with chorus

1.  Once it was the blessing, Now it is the Lord;

Once it was the feeling, Now it is His Word;

Once His gift I wanted, Now, the Giver own;

Once I sought for healing, Now Himself alone.

All in all forever, Only Christ I’ll sing;

Everything is in Christ, And Christ is everything.

2.  Once ’twas painful trying, Now ’tis perfect trust;

Once a half salvation, Now the uttermost;

Once ’twas ceaseless holding, Now He holds me fast;

Once ’twas constant drifting, Now my anchor’s cast.

3.  Once ’twas busy planning, Now ’tis trustful prayer;

Once ’twas anxious caring, Now He has the care;

Once ’twas what I wanted, Now what Jesus says;

Once ’twas constant asking, Now ’tis ceaseless praise.

4.  Once it was my working, His it hence shall be;

Once I tried to use Him, Now He uses me;

Once the pow’r I wanted, Now the Mighty One;

Once for self I labored, Now for Him alone.

5.  Once I hoped in Jesus, Now I know He’s mine;

Once my lamps were dying, Now they brightly shine;

Once for death I waited, Now His coming hail;

And my hopes are anchored Safe within the veil.
