# 176 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,

Teach me how to breathe Thee in;

Help me pour into Thy bosom

All my life of self and sin.

I am breathing out my sorrow,

Breathing out my sin;

I am breathing, breathing, breathing,

All Thy fullness in.

2.  I am breathing out my own life,

That I may be filled with Thine;\
Letting go my strength and weakness,\
Breathing in Thy life divine.

3.  Breathing out my sinful nature,

Thou hast borne it all for me;\
Breathing in Thy cleansing fullness,\
Finding all my life in Thee.

4.  I am breathing out my sorrow,\
On Thy kind and gentle breast;\
Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,\
Breathing in Thy peace and rest.

5.  I am breathing out my sickness,

Thou hast borne its burden too;

I am breathing in Thy healing,

Ever promised, ever new.

6.  I am breathing out my longings

In Thy listening, loving ear;

I am breathing in Thy answers,

Stilling every doubt and fear.

7.  I am breathing every moment,

Drawing all my life from Thee;

Breath by breath I live upon Thee,

Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.
