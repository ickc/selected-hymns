# 301 8.6.8.6. with chorus

1.  I have a song I love to sing,

Since I have been redeemed,

Of my Redeemer, Savior, King—

Since I have been redeemed.

Since I have been redeemed,

Since I havebeen redeemed,

I will glory in His name;

Since I have been redeemed,

I will glory in the Savior’s name.

2.  I have a Christ that satisfies,

Since I have been redeemed,

To do His will my highest prize—

Since I have been redeemed.

3.  I have a witness bright and clear,

Since I have been redeemed,

Dispelling every doubt and fear—

Since I have been redeemed.

4.  I have a joy I can’t express,

Since I have been redeemed,

All through the Lord, my righteousness—

Since I have been redeemed.

5.  I have a God who is for me,

Since I have been redeemed,

With whom I’ll dwell eternally—

Since I have been redeemed.
