# 546 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus

1.  Crucified with Christ my Savior,

To the world and self and sin;

To the death-born life of Jesus

I am sweetly ent’ring in:

In His fellowship of suff’ring,

To His death conformed to be,

I am going with my Savior

All the way to Calvary.

All the way to Calvary,

Where my Savior went for me,

Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,

All the way to Calvary.

2.  ’Tis not hard to die with Christ

When His risen life we know;

’Tis not hard to share His suff’rings

When our hearts with joy o’erflow.

In His resurrection power

He has come to dwell in me,

And my heart is gladly going

All the way to Calvary.

3.  If we die we’ll live with Christ,

If we suffer we shall reign;

Only thus the prize of glory

Can the conqueror attain.

Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning

Should the Master say to thee,

“Yes, my child, thou didst go with me

All the way to Calvary.”
