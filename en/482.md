1.  Fade, fade each earthly joy;\
Jesus is mine.\
Break every tender tie;\
Jesus is mine.\
Dark is the wilderness,\
Earth has no resting place,\
Jesus alone can bless;\
Jesus is mine.

2.  Tempt not my soul away;\
Jesus is mine.\
Here would I ever stay;\
Jesus is mine.\
Perishing things of clay,\
Born but for one brief day,\
Pass from my heart away;\
Jesus is mine.

3.  Farewell, ye dreams of night;

Jesus is mine.

Lost in this dawning bright;

Jesus is mine.

All that my soul has tried

Left but a dismal void;

Jesus has satisfied;

Jesus is mine.

4.  Farewell, mortality;

Jesus is mine.

Welcome, eternity;

Jesus is mine.

Welcome, O Loved and Blest,

Wecome, sweet scenes of rest,

Welcome, my Saviorâ€™s breast;

Jesus is mine.
