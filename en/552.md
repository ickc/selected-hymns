# 552 4.10.8.8.6.

1.  Hast thou no scar?

No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand?

I hear thee sung throughout the land,

I hear them hail thy shining star,

Hast thou no scar? no scar?

2.  Hast thou no wound?

Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,

Leaned Me against a tree; and rent

By ravening beasts â€˜round Me, I swooned:

Hast thou no wound? no wound?

3.  No wound? no scar?

Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,

And pierced the feet that follow Me;

But whole? can he have followed far

Who has no wound nor scar?
