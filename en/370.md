1.  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,

Naught of this world’s delusive dream;

I have renounced all sinful pleasure;

Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.

Nothing between my soul and the Savior,

So that His blessed face may be seen;

Nothing preventing the least of His favor,

Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

2.  Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;

Habits of life, though harmless they seem,

Must not my heart from Him e’er sever;

He is my all, there’s nothing between.

3.  Nothing between, like pride or station;

Self-life or friends shall not intervene;

Though it may cost me much tribulation,

I am resolved; there’s nothing between.

4.  Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,

Though the whole world against me convene;

Watching with prayer and much self-denial,

I’ll triumph at last, with nothing between.
