1.  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

We will be raptured, with glory transformed;

Glorified with Him, Himself to enjoy,

In His full likeness we then will be formed.

Glorious hope! Christ will return!

We will be raptured, with glory transformed;

O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

2.  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

The old creation will vanish away,

No more we'll groan, but have full liberty,

Enjoy salvation in its utmost way.

3.  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

Over the nations with Him we will reign,

Priests we will be in His presence to serve,

Thus His salvation in fulness we'll gain.

4.  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

Waiting and watching, we faithfully serve,

Running the race, pressing on toward the goal

That we the Kingdom's reward might deserve.
