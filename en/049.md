# 049 8.8.8.7. with chorus

1.  The name of Jesus is so sweet,

I love its music to repeat;

It makes my joys full and complete,

The precious name of Jesus.

Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,

Jesus! Evâ€™ry day the same;

Jesus! Let all saints proclaim

Its worthy praise forever.

2.  I love the name of Him whose heart

Knows all my griefs and bears a part;

Who bids all anxious fears depart,

I love the name of Jesus.

3.  That name I fondly love to hear,

It never fails my heart to cheer,

Its music dries the failing tear;

Exalt the name of Jesus.

4.  No word of man can ever tell

How sweet the name I love so well,

Oh, let its praises ever swell,

Oh, praise the name of Jesus.
