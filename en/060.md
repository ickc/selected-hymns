# 060 8.6.8.6.

1.  Jesus, the name high over all,

In hell, or earth, or sky:

Angels and men before it fall,

And devils fear and fly.

2.  Jesus, the name to sinners dear,

The name to sinners giv’n;

It scatters all their guilty fear,

It turns their hell to heav’n.

3.  Jesus the prisoner’s fetters breaks,

And bruises Satan’s head;

Pow’r into strengthless souls He speaks,

And life into the dead.

4.  Oh, that the world might taste and see,

The riches of His grace!

The arms of love that compass me,

Would all mankind embrace.

5.  His only righteousness I show,

His saving truth proclaim:

’Tis all my business here below,

To cry, Behold the Lamb!

6.  Happy, if with my latest breath

I may but gasp His name:

Preach Him to all, and cry in death,

“Behold, behold the Lamb!”
