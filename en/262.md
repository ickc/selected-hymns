# 262 7.8.7.8. with chorus

1.  From heav’n You came, helpless babe,

Enter’d our world, Your glory veil’d:

Not to be served but to serve,

And give Your life that we might live.

This is our God, the Servant King,

He calls us now to follow Him,

To bring our lives as a daily offering

Of worship to the Servant king.

2.  There in the garden of tears,

My heavy load He chose to bear;

His heart with sorrow was torn,

Yet not my will but Yours,’ He said.

3.  Come see His hands and His feet,

The scars that speak of sacrifice,

Hands that flung stars into space

To cruel nails surrendered.

4.  So let us learn how to serve,

And in our lives enthrone Him;

Each other’s needs to prefer,

For it is Christ we’re serving.
