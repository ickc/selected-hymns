The seven local churches see:<br />
The lessons there for you and me<br />
Are for the Lord’s recovery.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">The words to them are words to us,<br />
So that the church be glorious,<br />
And all their warnings we must heed<br />
So that the Lord can meet His need.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">To Ephesus, the word is clear:<br />
“To your first love you’re not so near;<br />
You’ve left to work so far away;<br />
Repent, return to Him today.”</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Thus, we must all turn back to Him,<br />
Leave other loves, for these are sin.<br />
Oh, let us hearken to His call—<br />
If we miss this, we’ve missed it all!</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore—<br />
“You have been tried, but something more—<br />
Be faithful unto death,” we’re told<br />
(Not just of body but of soul).</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Be faithful ‘til what’s natural dies;<br />
Your circumstances don’t despise;<br />
The Lord has sent them all to you<br />
To prove that your first love is true.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">From Pergamos we clearly see<br />
The world has wed Christianity!<br />
And faithful Antipas did fall—<br />
He dared to stand against it all.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">To wed the world we all must fear:<br />
His spoken word will save us here—<br />
If to His speaking we give heed,<br />
We’ll separated be indeed.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Then Thyatira comes at length:<br />
Her mixture with the world her strength.<br />
Fine flour leavened by the yeast,<br />
A harlot riding on a beast.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;<br />
To us this mixture fully show.<br />
Each added thing we will refute<br />
Until we’re wholly absolute.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">And then from Sardis, we can know<br />
Life is the way that we must go!<br />
She says she’s living, but she’s dead;<br />
She needs to touch the Lord instead.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Lord, take us all the way to life<br />
To overcome the deadness rife.<br />
Away from deadness we would flee<br />
That full of life we’ll always be.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Now Philadelphia comes at last;<br />
That which she has she should hold fast—<br />
The brothers’ love, the name, the word;<br />
This church has satisfied the Lord.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">We as the brothers all are one;<br />
We’re one by life, and life alone.<br />
If we His word and name do keep<br />
A glorious building God will reap.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Laodicea warns us all:<br />
From Philadelphia some will fall.<br />
By saying, “I am rich,” it’s then<br />
The Lord is outside wanting in.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Lukewarmness we must ever spurn<br />
And in the spirit always bum,<br />
The inward life experience gain,<br />
And pay the price with Him to reign.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Lord, shine Your light on us today<br />
That we may fully go Your way;<br />
Anoint our eyes and let us see<br />
So You can have recovery.</div></li>

Now its fruit is fully ripened,<br />
Comforted the vine would be;<br />
But the harvest soon is coming,<br />
And its days of comfort flee.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Hands will pick and feet will trample<br />
All the riches of the vine,<br />
Till from out the reddened wine-press<br />
Flows a river full of wine.<br />
All the day its flow continues,<br />
Bloody-red, without alloy,<br />
Gushing freely, richly, sweetly,<br />
Filling all the earth with joy.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">In appearance now the grape vine<br />
Barren is and pitiful;<br />
Having given all, it enters<br />
Into night inscrutable.<br />
No one offers to repay it<br />
For the cheering wine that’s drunk,<br />
But ’tis stripped and cut e’en further<br />
To a bare and branchless trunk.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Yet its wine throughout the winter<br />
Warmth and sweetness ever bears<br />
Unto those in coldness shiv’ring,<br />
Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.<br />
Yet without, alone, the grape vine<br />
Midst the ice and snow doth stand,<br />
Steadfastly its lot enduring,<br />
Though, tis hard to understand.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Winter o’er, the vine prepareth<br />
Fruit again itself to bear;<br />
Budding forth and growing branches,<br />
Beauteous green again to wear;<br />
Never murmuring or complaining<br />
For the winter’s sore abuse,<br />
Or for all its loss desiring<br />
Its fresh off’ring to reduce.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,<br />
As it lifts its arms on high,<br />
Earth’s impure, defiled affections<br />
Ne’er the vine may occupy.<br />
Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,<br />
And while love doth prune once more,<br />
Strokes it bears as if it never<br />
Suffered loss and pain before.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">From the branches of the grape vine<br />
Sap and blood and wine doth flow.<br />
Does the vine, for all it suffered,<br />
Lost, and yielded, poorer grow?<br />
Drunkards of the earth and wanderers,<br />
From it drink and merry make.<br />
From their pleasure and enjoyment<br />
Do they richer thereby wake?</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Not by gain our life is measured,<br />
But by what we’ve lost ’tis scored;<br />
’Tis not how much wine is drunken,<br />
But how much has been outpoured.<br />
For the strength of love e’er standeth<br />
In the sacrifice we bear;<br />
He who has the greatest suff’ring<br />
Ever has the most to share.</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">He who treats himself severely<br />
Is the best for God to gain;<br />
He who hurts himself most dearly<br />
Most can comfort those in pain.<br />
He who suffering never beareth<br />
Is but empty “sounding brass”;<br />
He who self-life never spareth<br />
Has the joys which all surpass.</div></li>

Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;<br />
How can I take my harp down from the willow?<br />
How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?<br />
And when at night I’m keeping lonely vigil—<br />
Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer—<br />
Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,<br />
But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;<br />
Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;<br />
Thy coming bids me seek a better country,<br />
For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.<br />
Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,<br />
My song the sweetness I would fain convey.<br />
Since Thou art gone the sense of void o’erwhelms me.<br />
Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.</div></li>

Yet in my heart there’s still a sense of lack.<br />
Enlightening and tenderest sustaining<br />
Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.<br />

Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;<br />
When I feel most content, the silent yearning<br />
To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.</div></li>

And long his people once again to greet?<br />

With all the joy of Thy return compare?<br />
Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,<br />
What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Could’st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise<br />
Soon to return and take me unto Thee?<br />
Yet day by day and year by year I’ve waited<br />
And still I wait, and no return I see!<br />
Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting<br />

How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer<br />
Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?</div></li>

Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen<br />
Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.<br />
How long, how very long the time has been!<br />

Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?<br />
Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further<br />
Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?</div></li>
<li><div class="line-block">Lord, I recall the many years I’ve waited<br />
For Thy return—yet, Lord, not I alone,<br />
But Thy dear saints through many generations—<br />
Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.<br />

By Thine appearing haste to make reply.<br />
