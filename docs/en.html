<li>We have seen Christ is reality:</li>

<p>But it’s not sufficient just to see:</p>
<p>He in our experience must be</p>
<p>Everything to us.</p>
<p>We in prayer behold Him face to face,</p>
<p>In the Word and meetings know His grace;</p>
<p>But in daily life, in every place,</p>
<p>What is He to us?</p>
<p>Hallelujah! By His light we see</p>
<p>Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be</p>
<p>If we’ll only turn to Him at every time,</p>
<p>in every day,</p>
<p>Every thing, in every way and—</p>
