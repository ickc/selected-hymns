<h1>1</h1>
<div class="line-block">There were ninety and nine that safely lay<br />
一百隻羊，少了一口，<br />
In the shelter of the flock,<br />
良牧耶穌悲愁，<br />
But one was out on the hills away,<br />
不顧山路崎嶇難走，<br />
Far off in the cold and dark;<br />
冒險前往尋救。<br />
Away on the mountains wild and bare,<br />
迷羊回頭！迷羊回頭！<br />
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.<br />
前面盡是陷阱、猛獸；<br />
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.<br />
火速回來，勿再逗遛！</div>

<h1>2</h1>
<div class="line-block">“Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;<br />
Are they not enough for Thee?”<br />
But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine<br />
Has wandered away from Me;<br />
And although the road be rough and steep,<br />
I go to the desert to find My sheep.<br />
I go to the desert to find My sheep.”</div>
</section>
<section id="section-2" class="slide level1">
<h1>3</h1>
<div class="line-block">But none of the ransomed ever knew<br />
How deep were the waters crossed;<br />
Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed through<br />
Ere He found His sheep that was lost.<br />
Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry—<br />
All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.<br />
All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.</div>

<section id="section-3" class="slide level1">
<h1>4</h1>
<div class="line-block">“Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way<br />
That mark out the mountain’s track?”<br />
“They were shed for one who had gone astray<br />
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”<br />
<q>Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?</q><br />
<q>They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.</q><br />
<q>They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.</q></div>
</section>
<section id="section-4" class="slide level1">
<h1>5</h1>
<div class="line-block">And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,<br />
And up from the rocky steep,<br />
There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,<br />
<q>Rejoice! I have found My sheep!</q><br />
And the angels echoed around the throne,<br />
<q>Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!</q><br />
<q>Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!</q></div>
