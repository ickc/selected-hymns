All kingdoms His scepter shall own.<br />

His burden we willingly bear.<br />

<div class="line-block">I’m dwelling with Jesus my King;<br />
我與耶穌我王同住，<br />
I’ve found where He dwells with His own;<br />
我已尋到祂的居所；<br />
I’ve opened the door of my heart;<br />

He’s made it His temple and throne.<br />
祂使我心成祂寶座。<br />
Like Mary I sit at His feet,<br />
像馬利亞坐祂腳前，<br />
Like John I recline on His breast;<br />
又像約翰躺祂懷中；<br />
His presence is fullness of joy,<br />
祂的同在，使我心歡，<br />
His bosom is infinite rest.<br />
祂的胸懷，使我安寧。</div>

<div class="line-block">I dwell with the King for His work,<br />
為祂事工，與王同住，<br />
I’ve part in His glorious plan<br />
有分於祂榮耀計劃，<br />
To bring in His kingdom to earth<br />
在地帶進祂的國度，<br />
And tell His salvation to man.<br />
將祂救恩向人傳達。<br />
The world has its work and rewards,<br />
世界有其工作、賞賜，<br />
I count them but folly and loss;<br />

My business is only His work,<br />
惟祂事工，是我職事，<br />
My message is only His cross.<br />
惟祂十架，是我信息。</div>

<div class="line-block">I dwell with the King for His work,<br />
為祂事工，與王同住，<br />
The work, it is His and not mine;<br />
是祂事工，不是我的；<br />
He plans and prepares it for me<br />
祂來計劃，祂來鋪路，<br />
And fills me with power divine.<br />
充滿我以神聖能力。<br />
So duty is changed to delight,<br />
因此責任變作悅事，<br />
And prayer into praise as I sing;<br />
禱告變作歌唱、讚美；<br />
I dwell with my King for His work<br />
為祂事工，與王同住，<br />
And work in the strength of my King.<br />
靠王能力，有所作為。</div>

為祂事工，與王同住，<br />
And work thru each day of the year.<br />
日以繼夜，殷勤作工；<br />
Perhaps ere it passes, the King<br />
也許事工尚未止住，<br />
In glory Himself shall appear.<br />
我王即已榮耀再臨。<br />
Oh, then in some closer embrace,<br />
與祂更近，何等有福，<br />
Oh, then in some nobler employ<br />
事工更尊，何等權柄；<br />
We’ll dwell with the King for His work<br />
為祂事工，與王永住，<br />
In endless, ineffable joy!<br />
難言喜樂，永無止境。</div>
