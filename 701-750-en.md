1 Life at best is very brief,

Like the falling of a leaf,

Like the binding of a sheaf,

Be in time!

Fleeting days are telling fast

That the die will soon be cast,

And the fatal line be passed,

Be in time!

Be in time! Be in time!

While the voice of Jesus calls you,

Be in time!

If in sin you longer wait,

You may find no open gate,

And your cry be just too late:

Be in time!

2 Fairest flowers soon decay,

Youth and beauty pass away;

O you have not long to stay,

Be in time!

While God’s Spirit bids you come,

Sinner, do not longer roam,

Lest you seal your hopeless doom,

Be in time!

3 Time is gliding swiftly by,

Death and judgment draweth nigh,

To the arms of Jesus fly,

Be in time!

O I pray you count the cost!

Ere the fatal line be crossed,

And your soul in hell be lost,

Be in time!

4 Sinner, heed the warning voice,

Make the Lord your final choice,

Then all heaven will rejoice,

Be in time!

Come from darkness into light;

Come, let Jesus make you right;

Come, receive His life tonight,

Be in time!

While the tempest still is high:

Hide me, O my Savior, hide,

Till the storm of life is past;

Safe into the haven guide;

O receive my soul at last.

Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;

From Thy riven side which flowed,

Be of sin the double cure,

Save me from its guilt and power.

Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;

Could my zeal no respite know,

Could my tears forever flow,

All could never sin erase,

Thou must save, and save by grace.

Simply to Thy cross I cling;

Naked, come to Thee for dress,

Helpless, look to Thee for grace:

Foul, I to the fountain fly,

Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When mine eyes shall close in death,

When I soar to worlds unknown,

See Thee on Thy judgment throne,

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee.

1 Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,

When Thou camest to each for me;

For Thy holy nativity:

There is room in my heart for Thee;

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,

There is room in my heart for Thee.

Proclaiming Thy royal degree;

But of lowly birth cam’st Thou, Lord, on earth,

And in great humility:

3 The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest

In the Shade of the forest tree;

But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,

In the deserts of Galilee:

4 Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word

That should set Thy people free;

But with mocking’ scorn, and with crown of thorn,

They bore Thee to Calvary:

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!

Thy cross is my only plea;

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,

Thy cross is my only plea.

5 When heaven’s arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing

At Thy coming to victory,

Let Thy voice call me up, saying, “Yet there is room,

There is room at My side for thee!”

And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!

When Thou comest and callest for me;

And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!

When Thou comest and callest for me.

1 There were ninety and nine that safely lay

In the shelter of the flock,

But one was out on the hills away,

Far off in the cold and dark;

Away on the mountains wild and bare,

Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2 “Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;

Are they not enough for Thee?”

But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine

Has wandered away from Me;

And although the road be rough and steep,

I go to the desert to find My sheep.”

3 But none of the ransomed ever knew

How deep were the waters crossed;

Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed through Ere He found
His sheep that was lost.

Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry—

All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.

4 “Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way

That mark out the mountain’s track?”

“They were shed for one who had gone astray

Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”

“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?”

“They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.”

5 And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,

And up from the rocky steep,

There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,

“Rejoice! I have found My sheep!”

And the angels echoed around the throne,

“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!”

That I may take it in—

That wonderful redemption,

God’s remedy for sin;

Tell me the story often,

For I forget so soon,

The “early dew” of morning

Has passed away at noon.

3 Tell me the story softly,

With earnest tones and grave;

Remember I’m the sinner

Whom Jesus came to save;

Tell me the story always,

If you would really be,

In any time of trouble,

A comforter to me.

When you have cause to fear

That this world’s empty glory

Is costing me too dear;

1 If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Were my life worth living for a day?

Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort

In the things that soon must pass away?

If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?

Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing

For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

2 Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,

And a name revered both far and near,

Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,

Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;

If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,

Who endured the cross and died for me,

Could then all the world afford a refuge,

Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

3 O what emptiness!—without the Savior

‘Mid the sins and sorrows here below!

And eternity, how dark without Him!

Only night and tears and endless woe!

What, though I might live without the Savior,

When I come to die, how would it be?

O to face the valley’s gloom without Him!

And without Him all eternity!

4 O the joy of having all in Jesus!

What a balm the broken heart to heal!

Ne’er a sin so great, but He’ll forgive it,

Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!

If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,

Nothing else in all the world beside—

O then everything is mine in Jesus;

For my needs and more He will provide.

1 Send Thou, O Lord, to every place

Swift messengers before Thy face,

The heralds of Thy wondrous grace,

Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

2 Send men whose eyes have seen the King!

Men in whose ears His sweet words ring;

Send such Thy lost ones home to bring;

Send them where Thou wilt come.

3 To bring good news to souls in sin;

The bruised and broken hearts to win;

In every place to bring them in,

Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

4 Gird each one with the Spirit’s sword,

The sword of Thine own deathless word;

And make them conquerors, conquering Lord,

Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

5 Raise up, O Lord the Holy Ghost,

From this broad land a mighty host,

Their war-cry, We will seek the lost,

Where Thou, O Christ, wilt come!

1 Jesus and shall it ever be?

A mortal man ashamed of Thee?

Ashamed of Thee, Whom angels praise,

Whose glories shine thro’ endless days?

2 Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far

Let night disown each radiant star:

’Tis midnight with my soul, till He.

Bright Morning Star’, bid darkness flee.

3 Ashamed of Jesus! O as soon

Let morning blush to own the sun;

He sheds the beams of light divine,

O’er this benighted soul of mine.

4 Ashamed of Jesus! that dear friend

On whom my glorious hope depends?

No, when blush, be this my shame,

That I no more revere His Name.

5 Till then—nor is the boasting vain—

Till then, I boast a Savior slain;

And, O may this my glory be,

That Christ is not ashamed of me.

732 5.4.5.4.D.

1 Out in the darkness, Shadowed by sin,

Souls are in bondage, Souls we would win.

How can we win them? How show the way?

“Love never faileth,”

Love is the way.

2 Think how the Savior Came from above,

Suffered on Calvary, Breathing out love;

Think how He loves us, E’en when we stray:

We must love others,

Love is His way.

3 See, they are waiting,

Looking at you,

Silently watching All that you do;

Seeming so careless, Hardened and lost:

“Love never faileth,” Count not the cost.

4 “Love never faileth,” Love is pure gold;

Love is what Jesus Came to unfold;

Love these souls thru us, Savior, we pray;

Thy love ne’er faileth,

Love is Thy way.

733 8.7.8.7.D.

1 “Must I go, and empty-handed,”

Thus my dear Redeemer meet?

Not one day of service give Him,

Lay no trophy at His feet?

“Must I go, and empty-handed?”

Must I meet my Savior so?

Not one soul with which to greet Him:

Must I empty-handed go?

2 Not at death I shrink nor falter,

For my Savior saves me now;

But to meet Him empty-handed,

Thought of that now clouds my brow.

3 O the years in sinning wasted;

Could I but recall them now,

I would give them to my Savior,

To His will I’d gladly bow.

4 O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,

Up and work while yet ’tis day;

Ere the night of death o’ertake thee,

Strive for souls while still you may.

Even life for evermore.
