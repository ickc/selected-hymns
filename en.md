The saints’ and angels’ song.

The saints’ and angels’ song.

Though stretched from sky to sky.

Is the current of Thy love;

Leading onward, leading homeward,

To my glorious rest above.

Spread His praise form shore to shore;

How He loveth, ever loveth,

Watcheth o’er them from the throne.

# 137 13.13.13.13. with chorus

1.  I stand all amazed at the

love Jesus offers me,

Confused at the grace that so

fully He proffers me;

I tremble to know that for

me He was crucified,

That for me, a sinner, He

suffered, He bled and died.

O it is wonderful that

He should care for me

Enough to die for me!

O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

2.  I marvel that He would descend

from His throne divine

To rescue a soul so rebellious

and proud as mine;

That He should extend His great

love unto such as I,

Sufficient to own, to redeem,

and to justify.

3.  I think of His side, pierced and

bleeding to pay the debt,

Such mercy, such love and

devotion can I forget?

No, no! I will praise and adore

at the mercy seat,

Until at the glorified throne

I kneel at His feet.

# 138 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  I stand amazed in the presence

Of Jesus the Nazarene,

And wonder how He could love me,

A sinner condemned, unclean.

How marvelous! How wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

How Marvelous! How wonderful!

Is my Savior’s love for me!

2.  For me it was in the garden,

He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”

He had no tears for His own griefs,

But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

3.  In pity angels beheld Him,

And came from the world of light

To strengthen Him in the sorrows

He bore for my soul that night.

4.  He took my sins and my sorrows,

He made them His very own;

He bore the burden to Calv’ry,

And suffered, and died alone.

5.  When with the ransomed in glory

His face I at last shall see,

‘Twill be my joy through the ages

To sing of His love for me.

# 139 8.6.8.6.

So great! So full! So free!

Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,

Our lives, engaged with Thee.

2.  We love Thee for the glorious worth

Which in Thyself we see;

We love Thee for that shameful cross,

Endured so patiently.

3.  No man of greater love can boast

Than for His friend to die;

Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!

What love with Thine can vie?

4.  Though in the very form of God,

With heav’nly glory crowned,

Thou didst a servant’s form assume,

Beset with sorrow round.

5.  Thou wouldst like wretched man be made

In everything but sin,

That we as like Thee might become

As we unlike had been:

6.  Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,

In every beauteous grace;

From glory unto glory changed,

Till we behold Thy face.

7.  O Lord, we treasure in our hearts

The memory of Thy love;

And ever shall Thy name to us

A grateful odor prove.

# 140 8.8.8.8.4.4.8.8.

1.  I have a Friend, whose faithful love

Is more than all the world to me:

‘Tis higher than the heights above,

And deeper than the soundless sea;

So old, so new, So strong, so true;

Before the earth received its frame,

He loved me—Blessed be His name!

2.  He held the highest place above,

Adored by all the sons of flame,

Yet such His self-denying love,

He laid aside His crown and came

To seek the lost, And at the cost

Of heavenly rank and earthly fame

He sought me—Blessed be His name!

3.  It was a lonely path He trod,

From every human soul apart;

Known only to Himself and God

Was all the grief that filled His heart,

Yet from the track He turned not back

Till where I lay in want and shame,

He found me—Blessed be His name!

4.  Then dawned at last that day of dread,

When desolate, yet undismayed,

With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,

He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,

Was then made sin On Calvary,

And, dying there in grief and shame,

He saved me—Blessed be His name!

5.  Long as I live my song shall tell

The wonders of His dying love;

And when at last I go to dwell

In that bright home with Him above,

My joy shall be His face to see,

And bowing there with loud acclaim

I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!

# 141 8.6.8.6.

1.  Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?

O height, O depth of love!

Thou one with us on Calvary,

We one Thee above.

2.  Such was Thy grace that for our sake

Thou didst from heaven come down,

With us of flesh and blood partake,

In all our misery one.

3.  Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine

Confessed and home by Thee;

The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,

To set Thy members free.

4.  Ascended now, in glory bright,

Head of the Church Thou art;

Nor life nor death, nor depth nor height,

Thy saints and Thee can part.

5.  Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own

This wondrous mystery,

That Thou in heaven with us art one,

And we are one with Thee.

6.  Soon, soon shall come that glorious day

When, seated on Thy throne,

Thou shalt to wondering worlds display

That Thou with us art one.

# 142 10.10.10.10.4.

1.  It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine

Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,

Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,

Know more and more.

2.  It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine

Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,

A love which can remove all guilty fear,

And love beget.

3.  It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,

My Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine

Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,

Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,

Nigh unto God.

4.  But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know

The fulness of Thy love, while here below,

My empty vessel I may freely bring;

O Thou, who art of love the living spring,

My vessel fill.

5.  I am an empty vessel—not one thought

Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;

Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,

With this the empty sinner’s only plea,

Thou lovest me.

6.  Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!

Lead, lead me to the living fount above;

Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,

And never to another fountain fly,

But unto Thee.

7.  Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,

When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,

Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,

Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,

My soul shall sing.

# 143 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  Majestic sweetness sits enthroned

Upon the Savior’s brow;

His head with radiant glories crowned,

His lips with grace o’erflow.

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  No mortal can with Him compare

Among the sons of men;

Fairer is He than all the fair

That fill the heavenly train.

3.  He saw me plunged in deep distress,

He flew to my relief;

For me He bore the shameful cross

And carried all my grief.

4.  To God, the Father, my abode,

He brings my weary feet;

Shows me the glories of my God,

And makes my joys complete.

5.  Since from His bounty I receive

Such proofs of love divine,

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

Lord, they should all be Thine.

# 144 8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6.

1.  King of my life, I crown Thee now,

Thine shall the glory be;

Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,

Lead me to Calvary.

Lest I forget Gethsemane;

Lest I forget Thine agony;

Lest I forget Thy love for me,

Lead me to Calvary.

2.  Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

Tenderly moumed and wept;

Angels in robes of light arrayed

Guarded Thee while Thou slept.

3.  Let me like Mary, through the gloom,

Come with a gift to Thee;

Show to me now the empty tomb,

Lead me to Calvary.

4.  May I be willing, Lord, to bear

Daily my cross for Thee;

Even Thy cup of grief to share,

Thou hast home all for me.

5.  Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire

For all that know not Thee;

Then touch my lips with holy fire.

To speak of Calvary.

# 145 11.12.12.12.

stands a great throng

In the presence of Jesus and sing

this new song.

defiled in His sight,

Now arrayed in pure garments, in

praise they unite.

3.  He maketh the rebel a priest

and a king,

He hath bought us, and taught us

this new song to sing.

4.  How helpless and hopeless

we sinners had been,

If He never had loved us till cleansed

from our sin.

shall ring,

So that others, believing, this new

song shall sing.

My great Redeemer’s praise,

Assist me to proclaim,

To spread through all the earth abroad,

The honors of Thy name.

3.  Jesus! the name that charms our fears,

That bids our sorrows cease;

’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,

’Tis life, and health, and peace.

4.  His love my heart has captive made,

His captive would I be,

For He was bound, and scourged and died,

My captive soul to free.

5.  He breaks the power of canceled sin,

He sets the prisoner free;

His blood can make the foulest clean;

His blood availed for me.

6.  So now Thy blessed Name I love,

Thy will would e’er be mine.

Had I a thousand hearts to give,

My Lord, they all were Thine!

# 147 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  Jesus, wondrous Savior!

Christ, of kings the King!

Angels fall before Thee,

Prostrate, worshipping;

Fairest they confess Thee

In the heav’n above.

We would sing Thee fairest

Here in hymns of love.

2.  All earth’s flowing pleasures

Were a wintry sea;

Heav’n itself without Thee

Dark as night would be.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the light above.

Lamb of God! Thy glory

Is the life of love.

3.  Life is death, if severed

From Thy throbbing heart.

Death with life abundant

At Thy touch would start.

Worlds and men and angels

All consist in Thee,

Yet Thou earnest to us

In humility.

Rise and end in Thee;

Brightness of God’s glory

Thou, eternally.

Favored beyond measure

They Thy face who see;

May we, gracious Savior,

Share this ecstasy.

Fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring;

Fairer still the moonlight,

And all the twinkling starry host;

Jesus shines brighter,

Jesus shines purer,

Than all the angels heav’n can boast!

Where foes and snares abound;

Our hearts o’erflow with praise—

Content ourselves, while, Lord to Thee

A joyful song we raise.

Our Rock, our Food, our Light;

Into His house of wine!

I stand upon His merit;

I know no other stand.

I’m hidden in His presence

And held by His own hand.

3.  The Bride eyes not her garment,

But her dear Bridegroom’s face;

I will not gaze at glory,

But on my King of grace:

And my eternal stand!

Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,

Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

2.  Verily God, yet become truly human,

Lower than angels to die in our stead;

How has that long promised “Seed of the woman”

Trod on the serpent and bruised his head!

3.  How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken,

Led by Thy creatures and nailed to the cross,

Hated of men, and of God too forsaken,

Shunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss.

Battled death’s forces, rolled back every wave!

Can we refrain then from telling the story?

Lord, Thou art Victor o’er death and the grave.

Accompanied Thy faithful band,

It seemed they knew, but knew Thee not,

Thyself they did not understand.

Thy beauteous stature unforgot;

They crowded ‘round Thee, met Thy gaze,

But who Thou art, they knew it not.

We’ve known Thee long apparently;

Yet if we say we know, at best

We know Thee not transparently.

Another Comforter become;

Reveal Thyself within my heart,

Since to Thy temple Thou hast come.

That every part with glory shine

And everywhere be Thee and God.

Thy presence sweetly fills our souls;

Our hearts are to Thy praises giv’n.

Throbbing souls and holy songs

Wait to hail Thy dawning here.

To conquer and to reign!

A place, O Lord, for Thee.”

Our mighty God desires a home

To dwell with all His own.

2.  How blinded we have been,

Shut in with what concerns us;

While God’s house lieth waste—

Lord, break through all and turn us!

We’ll go up to the mountain,

Bring wood and build the house;

We’ll never say, “Another day!”

It’s time to come and build.

3.  O Lord, against these days,

Inspire some for Your building,

Just as in David’s day—

A remnant who are willing

To come and work in Your house,

Oh, what a blessed charge!

Your heart’s desire, is our desire—

We give ourselves to build.

4.  Within those whom You’d call

Put such a restless caring

For building to give all—

These times are for preparing;

The gates of hell cannot prevail

Against the builded Church!

The hours are few, the builders too—

We rise, O Lord, to build!

(Repeat the last four lines)

1.  See the golden lampstands,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Jesus’ testimony,

Bearing Him as light.

Formed by Him, unmeasured,

In the Spirit’s mold—

All are one in nature,

One pure work of gold.

See the golden lampstand,

‘Midst the earth’s dark night;

Burning in the Spirit,

Shining forth with Christ.

2.  God in Christ, embodied,

As God’s lampstand, He

Has become the Spirit,

The reality.

Spirit as the lampstand

Has been multiplied;

Many golden lampstands,

Now are realized!

3.  Caring for the churches

Is the Son of Man:

Voice of many waters,

Stars in His right hand;

Eyes aflame; His face is

Shining as the sun;

Churches—fear no trial,

He’s the living One!

4.  What can quench the lampstands?

Who can them defy?

More the opposition—

More they multiply!

Deeper darkness ‘round them,

Brighter do they shine.

They are constituted

With the life divine.

5.  Soon the golden lampstands

Shall the Bride become,

Bringing in that city—

New Jerusalem.

Then the many lampstands

Shall one lampstand be;

Triune God expressing,

Universally.

Lo, from heav’n descending,

All the earth shall see

God’s complete expression,

For eternity.

# 244 7.6.7.6.D. with chorus

1.  The churches are the Body

Of Christ on earth today.

They are His testimony,

That He may have a way.

They are the golden lampstands

In cities far and wide.

They are His fighting army,

And His beloved Bride.

The churches, the churches,

Upon the earth today;

Lord stir our hearts for Thy desire,

And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

2.  Oh, how we need the churches,

All of them, great or small!

We need their many portions

To profit us withal.

Yes, Lord, enlarge the churches;

We love their needs to bear.

Enlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,

In fellowship and prayer.

3.  The Lord’s eyes o’er the whole earth

Are running to and fro;

Those seven, burning, searching,

Our heart’s desire to know.

His purpose—many churches,

Built up in one accord;

This golden testimony

Will thus express the Lord.

4.  And soon will be the coming

Of our triumphant King!

He’s coming for the churches

Where His sweet praises ring.

Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,

As draws the harvest nigh,

And to Thy throne do take us,

To reign with Thee on high.

# 245 8.8.8.8.

1.  In Revelation chapter one

God gives a vision of the Son,

Of Him who was and is to come;

Oh, let us to this One now come.

2.  In spirit hear His trumpet voice;

We must be turned to see His choice

The seven lampstands golden fair;

The Son of Man is walking there.

3.  The great high priestly robe He wears,

For every church He fully cares:

He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;

He makes them bum, flames in His eyes.

4.  A golden girdle on His breast—

His work is done, and from His rest

He unto all the churches pours

Himself in love, the treasure store.

5.  His head, His hair is white as wool

The ancient One with youth is full.

His face is shining as the sun

To burn and lighten every one.

6.  Oh, when this living One we see,

We’ll fall as dead, we’ll finished be.

But then the Lord His comfort gives

He once was dead, but now He lives.

7.  Let every church just love Him more

His riches then He will outpour.

All other loves now lay aside;

Let’s take this Jesus, none beside.

# 246 8.8.8.8.

1.  In Revelation two and three,

The seven local churches see:

The lessons there for you and me

Are for the Lord’s recovery.

2.  The words to them are words to us,

So that the church be glorious,

And all their warnings we must heed

So that the Lord can meet His need.

3.  To Ephesus, the word is clear:

“To your first love you’re not so near;

You’ve left to work so far away;

Repent, return to Him today.”

4.  Thus, we must all turn back to Him,

Leave other loves, for these are sin.

Oh, let us hearken to His call—

If we miss this, we’ve missed it all!

5.  Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore—

“You have been tried, but something more—

Be faithful unto death,” we’re told

(Not just of body but of soul).

6.  Be faithful ‘til what’s natural dies;

Your circumstances don’t despise;

The Lord has sent them all to you

To prove that your first love is true.

7.  From Pergamos we clearly see

The world has wed Christianity!

And faithful Antipas did fall—

He dared to stand against it all.

8.  To wed the world we all must fear:

His spoken word will save us here—

If to His speaking we give heed,

We’ll separated be indeed.

9.  Then Thyatira comes at length:

Her mixture with the world her strength.

Fine flour leavened by the yeast,

A harlot riding on a beast.

10.  Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;

To us this mixture fully show.

Each added thing we will refute

Until we’re wholly absolute.

11.  And then from Sardis, we can know

Life is the way that we must go!

She says she’s living, but she’s dead;

She needs to touch the Lord instead.

12.  Lord, take us all the way to life

To overcome the deadness rife.

Away from deadness we would flee

That full of life we’ll always be.

13.  Now Philadelphia comes at last;

That which she has she should hold fast—

The brothers’ love, the name, the word;

This church has satisfied the Lord.

14.  We as the brothers all are one;

We’re one by life, and life alone.

If we His word and name do keep

A glorious building God will reap.

15.  Laodicea warns us all:

From Philadelphia some will fall.

By saying, “I am rich,” it’s then

The Lord is outside wanting in.

16.  Lukewarmness we must ever spurn

And in the spirit always bum,

The inward life experience gain,

And pay the price with Him to reign.

17.  Lord, shine Your light on us today

That we may fully go Your way;

Anoint our eyes and let us see

So You can have recovery.

# 247 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Glorious things to thee are spoken,

Philadelphia, church of love.

These things saith the One who’s holy,

He who’s real speaks from above;

He that has the key of David,

Who the kingdom’s entrance won,

“I will open, no man shutteth”—

He has spoken; it is done.

2.  Hallelujah, Philadelphia,

Thine are works that please the Lord.

Strength thou hast, though just a little

And hast kept His living Word.

Thou His holy name denied not,

But confessed it here below—

Lo, a door is set before thee,

Through which none but thee can go.

3.  Thou, beloved Philadelphia,

Dost His Word of patience keep.

From the hour of trial He’ll save thee,

Which o’er all the world shall sweep.

Troublers too shall know He loves thee;

They to thee must then bow down.

“Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,

That no man may take thy crown.”

4.  Hallelujah, overcomers,

“In the temple of My God,

I will build them in as pillars,

Nevermore to go abroad.”

God’s own name is written on them

And the new name of the Lord.

With the triune God they’re blended;

They’re the city of our God.

5.  Hallelujah, out of heaven,

Comes the New Jerusalem:

Gates of pearl and walls of jasper,

Mingled with each precious gem.

Philadelphia, Philadelphia,

Has become His Bride so dear.

Now the Spirit in the churches

Speaks to all who have an ear.

# 248 8.7.8.7.

1.  Oh, the Lord is quickly coming,

He has spoken in His word;

And confirmed it by the churches,

For His Spirit we have heard.

2.  Not to all the seven churches

Did the Lord speak in this way;

To the church in Philadelphia

Did He choose these words to say.

3.  Philadelphia, Philadelphia,

Church so full of brotherly love,

You’re the church to bring the Bridegroom

Back to earth from heav’n above.

4.  He that hath the key of David,

He that shuts and opens too,

Knows thy works, O Philadelphia;

That’s why you’re His Bride so true.

5.  Not so strong by worldly standards,

Hidden from religion’s fame;

Jesus loves you, Philadelphia,

For you’re faithful to His name.

6.  By His Word you’re overcoming—

How the Amen does resound!

Just hold fast to what you’ve gotten,

That no man may take your crown.

7.  You have kept His Word of patience;

He will keep you from that hour

Which upon the whole world cometh

When the Lord comes in His power.

8.  ""I come quickly,” Philadelphia,

Speaks the Lord to none but you; “Amen!

Quickly come, Lord Jesus”,

Answer back His faithful few.

# 249 9.8.8.9. with chorus

1.  God be with you till we meet again;

By His counsels guide, uphold you,

With His sheep in love enfold you;

God be with you till we meet again.

Till we meet, till we meet,

Till we meet at Jesus’ feet;

Till we meet, till we meet,

God be with you till we meet again.

2.  God be with you till we meet again!

‘Neath His wings protecting hide you,

Daily manna still provide you;

God be with you till we meet again!

3.  God be with you till we meet again!

When life’s perils thick confound you,

Put His arms unfailing round you;

God be with you till we meet again!

Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,

Smite death’s threatening wave before you;

God be with you till we meet again!

# 250 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus,

In spirit here we stand,

With hearts all full of praises,

To keep Thy blest command:

Our souls by faith rejoicing,

To trace Thy path of love,

Down through death’s angry billows,

Up to the throne above.

2.  Lord Jesus! we remember

The travail of Thy soul,

When through Thy love’s deep pity,

The waves did o’er Thee roll;

Baptized in death’s dark waters,

For us Thy blood was shed;

For us Thou, Lord of Glory,

Wast numbered with the dead.

3.  O Lord! Thou now art risen,

Thy travail all is o’er;

For sin Thou once hast suffered,

Thou liv’st to die no more;

Sin, death and hell are vanquished

By Thee, the Church’s Head;

And lo! we share Thy triumphs,

Thou first-born from the dead.

4.  Unto Thy death baptized,

We own with Thee we died;

With Thee, our Life, we’re risen,

And shall be glorified.

From sin, the world, and Satan.

We’re ransomed by Thy blood.

And here would walk as strangers.

Alive with Thee to God.

# 251 8.8.8.8.

1.  Is it Thy will that I should be

Buried, in symbol, Lord, with Thee;

Owning Thee by this solemn sign,

Telling the world that I am Thine?

2.  Gladly I yield obedience now;

In all things to Thy will I’d bow;

I’ll follow where my Savior led,

And humbly in His footsteps tread.

3.  This emblematic, watery grave

Shows forth His love—who came to save;

And as I enter it, I see

The price my Savior paid for me.

4.  Forth from Thy burial, Lord, I come,

For Thou hast triumphed o’er the tomb;

Thy resurrection life I share—

My portion is no longer here.

5.  Oh, may I count myself to be

Dead to the sins that wounded Thee,

Dead to the pleasures of this earth,

Unworthy of my heav’nly birth.

6.  Lord Jesus, when I gaze on Thee,

And all Thy radiant glory see,

That joy will far exceed the shame

I bear on earth for Thy loved name.

# 252 12.11.12.12

1.  We gather together to eat the Lord’s supper:

By eating and drinking, our oneness we show.

His presence possessing, our oneness confessing,

‘Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.

2.  We’re eating the bread of His body once broken

As now we’re enjoying His Body made one:

One loaf on the table-one Body, we’re able

To testify to all that the Lord’s made us one.

3.  We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,

The church’s true fellowship of the Lord’s blood;

Redeemed by believing, all saints we’re receiving,

All those who through redemption have come unto God.

4.  Oh, what can we say now except “Hallelujah!”

For such a reality given to us.

Thy blood we’re employing, Thy Body enjoying;

Thus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious.

# 253 9.8.8.9. with chorus

1.  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord,

Thou, the man, our Host, presiding,

In Thy house, Thy home, abiding;

Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Hallelujah for this feast!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

2.  How enjoyable Thy table, Lord!

As we fellowship around it,

Hallelujah, we have found it,

How enjoyable Thy table, Lord!

3.  Oh, how precious is Thy table, Lord—

Bread and wine Thy death announcing;

Here our soul-life we’re renouncing,

By partaking of Thy table, Lord.

4.  How significant Thy table, Lord—

We Thy Body in the loaf seen,

Object of Thy love bespeaking;

How significant Thy table, Lord!

5.  How refreshing is Thy table, Lord—

So completely satisfying,

Day by day our need supplying;

How refreshing is Thy table, Lord.

6.  How encouraging Thy table, Lord

“Till He come,” its promise giving

Hope, to fill our daily living;

How encouraging Thy table, Lord!

# 254 11.10.11.10. with chorus

1.  We’re gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:

Though we be many, yet we all are one.

We share Thy life and own that we are members,

And thus within, in life we all are one.

There is one Body in this universe,

And we express it here on earth;

We stand as one in each locality

For all to see, for all to see.

2.  There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:

‘Twas broken so that all the saints may share:

We eat this bread and, as we are partaking,

Our actual oness with all saints declare.

3.  One bread, one cup are now upon the table,

Showing that we can be naught else but one.

Christ has redeemed us, made us His own Body:

What can we say but, “Amen, Lord, we’re one!”

4.  We stand as one, and cannot be divided,

Because our oneness is of Christ alone.

We eat as one: one loaf, one cup partaking,

And thus our oneness visibly is shown.

5.  Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!

We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;

And we too share this blissful satisfaction

Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.

# 255 8.6.8.6.

1.  According to Thy gracious word,

In meek humility,

This will I do, my dying Lord,

I will remember Thee.

2.  Thy body, broken for my sake,

My bread from heaven shall be;

Thy testamental cup I take,

And thus remember Thee.

3.  Gethsemane can I forget?

Or there Thy conflict see,

Thine agony and bloody sweat,

And not remember Thee?

4.  When to the cross I turn mine eyes

And rest on Calvary,

O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,

I must remember Thee—

5.  Remember Thee and all Thy pains

And all Thy love to me;

Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,

I will remember Thee.

6.  And when these failing lips grow dumb

And mind and memory flee,

When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,

Jesus, remember me.

# 256 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Jesus spreads His banner o’er us,

Cheers our famished souls with food;

He the banquet spread before us,

Of His mystic flesh and blood.

Precious banquet, bread of heaven,

Wine of gladness, flowing free;

May we taste it, kindly given,

In remembrance Lord, of Thee.

2.  In Thy holy incarnation,

When the angels sang Thy birth;

In Thy fasting and temptation,

In Thy labors on the earth,

In Thy trial and rejection,

In Thy suff’rings on the tree,

In Thy glorious resurrection,

May we, Lord, remember Thee.

3.  In Thy wondrous crucifixion

Shunned by God, condemned by man.

Thou didst purchase our redemption,

Bridge in love the dreadful span.

Now to heav’n Thou hast ascended.

There for us to intercede;

Coming soon in glory splendid—

Blest remembrance, Lord, of Thee.

# 257 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present

At Thy table freshly spread,

Seated at Thy priceless banquet

With Thy banner overhead.

Precious moments at Thy table,

From all fear and doubt set free;

Here to rest, so sweetly able,

Occupied alone with Thee.

2.  Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,

Gladly by Thy Spirit led;

Calmly in the blest remembrance

Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.

Lord, we take each simple token

In fond memory of Thee,

Muse upon Thy body broken

And Thy blood shed on the tree.

3.  Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,

In these chosen emblems here;

In the bread and wine of blessing—

Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!

Lord, behold us met together,

One in Thee, our risen Head,

Thus we take the cup of blessing,

Thus we share the broken bread.

4.  Lord, we know how true Thy promise

To be with us where we meet,

When in Thy loved name we gather

To enjoy communion sweet;

Dearer still that looked-for promise

To each waiting, yearning heart,

That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,

Yes, “forever” where Thou art.

# 258 7.6.7.6.D.

1.  On that same night, Lord Jesus,

When all around Thee joined

To cast its darkest shadow

Across Thy holy mind,

We hear Thy voice, blest Savior,

“This do, remember me”,

With grateful hearts responding,

We do remember Thee.

2.  The depth of all Thy suffering

No heart could e’er conceive,

The cup of wrath overflowing

For us Thou didst receive;

And, oh, of God forsaken

On the accursed tree;

With grateful hearts, Lord Jesus,

We now remember Thee.

3.  We think of all the darkness

Which round Thy spirit pressed,

Of all those waves and billows,

Which rolled across Thy breast.

Oh, there Thy grace unbounded

And perfect love we see;

With joy and sorrow mingling,

We would remember Thee.

4.  We know Thee now as risen,

The Firstborn from the dead;

We see Thee now ascended,

The Church’s glorious Head.

In Thee by grace accepted,

The heart and mind set free

To think of all Thy sorrow,

And thus remember Thee.

5.  Till Thou shalt come in glory,

And call us hence away,

To rest in all the brightness

Of that unclouded day,

We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,

And here would seek to be

More to Thy death conformed,

While we remember Thee.

# 259 6.6.8.6.

1.  Sweet feast of love divine!

‘Tis grace that makes us free

To feed upon this bread and wine,

In mem’ry, Lord, of Thee.

2.  Here every welcome guest

Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn

The secrets of Thy Father’s breast,

And all Thy grace discern.

3.  Here conscience ends its strife,

And faith delights to prove

The sweetness of the Bread of Life,

The fullness of Thy love.

4.  That blood that flowed for sin

In symbol here we see,

And feel the blessed pledge within

That we are loved of Thee.

5.  O if this glimpse of love

Is so divinely sweet,

What will it be, O Lord, above,

Thy gladdening smile to meet!

6.  To see Thee face to face,

Thy perfect likeness wear,

And all Thy ways of wondrous grace

Through endless years declare.

# 260 10.10.10.10.

1.  Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;

Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;

Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,

And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

2.  Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav’n;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load;

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv’n.

3.  I have no help but Thine; nor do I need

Another arm save Thine to lean upon;

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.

4.  This is the hour of banquet and of song;

This is the heav’nly table spread for me;

Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong

The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.

5.  Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;

The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,

Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.

6.  Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,

Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,

Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,

The Lamb’s great bridal-feast of bliss and love.

# 261 7.7.7.6.

1.  For the bread and for the wine,

For the pledge that seals Him mine,

For the words of love divine,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

2.  Only bread and only wine,

Yet to faith, the solemn sign

Of the heav’nly and divine!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

3.  For the words that turn our eye

To the cross of Calvary,

Bidding us in faith draw nigh,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

4.  For the words that fragrance breathe

These plain symbols underneath,

Words that His own peace bequeath,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

5.  For Thy words in Spirit shown,

For Thy will to us made known.

“Do ye this until I come,”

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

6.  Till He come we take the bread,

Type of Him on whom we feed,

Him who liveth and was dead!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

7.  Till He come we take the cup;

As we at His table sup,

Eye and heart are lifted up!

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

8.  For that coming, here foreshown,

For that day to man unknown,

For the glory and the throne,

We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

# 262 7.8.7.8. with chorus

1.  From heav’n You came, helpless babe,

Enter’d our world, Your glory veil’d:

Not to be served but to serve,

And give Your life that we might live.

This is our God, the Servant King,

He calls us now to follow Him,

To bring our lives as a daily offering

Of worship to the Servant king.

2.  There in the garden of tears,

My heavy load He chose to bear;

His heart with sorrow was torn,

Yet not my will but Yours,’ He said.

3.  Come see His hands and His feet,

The scars that speak of sacrifice,

Hands that flung stars into space

To cruel nails surrendered.

4.  So let us learn how to serve,

And in our lives enthrone Him;

Each other’s needs to prefer,

For it is Christ we’re serving.

# 263 9.9.10.10.7.

Make me a servant, humble and meek,

Make me a servant today.

1.  We have a most glorious King;

The heavens, He says, are His throne;

All worlds are His mighty domain,

All kingdoms His scepter shall own.

He dwells with His people below,

He loves in their trials to share;

We dwell with the King I His work,

His burden we willingly bear.

2.  I’m dwelling with Jesus my King;

I’ve found where He dwells with His own;

I’ve opened the door of my heart;

He’s made it His temple and throne.

Like Mary I sit at His feet,

Like John I recline on His breast;

His presence is fullness of joy,

His bosom is infinite rest.

3.  I dwell with the King for His work,

I’ve part in His glorious plan

To bring in His kingdom to earth

And tell His salvation to man.

The world has its work and rewards,

I count them but folly and loss;

My business is only His work,

My message is only His cross.

4.  I dwell with the King for His work,

The work, it is His and not mine;

He plans and prepares it for me

And fills me with power divine.

So duty is changed to delight,

And prayer into praise as I sing;

I dwell with my King for His work

And work in the strength of my King.

5.  We’ll dwell with the King for His work

And work thru each day of the year.

Perhaps ere it passes, the King

In glory Himself shall appear.

Oh, then in some closer embrace,

Oh, then in some nobler employ

We’ll dwell with the King for His work

In endless, ineffable joy!

# 265 8.8.8.8.

1.  O Master, let me walk with Thee

In lowly paths of service free;

Tell me Thy secret, help me bear

The strain of toil, the fret of care.

2.  Help me the slow of heart to move

By some clear, winning word of love;

Teach me the wayward feet to stay,

And guide them in the homeward way.

3.  Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee

In closer, dearer company,

In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,

In trust that triumphs over wrong.

4.  In hope that sends a shining ray

Far down the future’s broadening way,

In peace that only Thou canst give,

With Thee, O Master, let me live.

1.  Lord, speak to me, that I may speak

In living echoes of Thy tone;

As Thou hast sought, so let me seek

Thy erring children lost and lone.

2.  O lead me, Lord, that I may lead

The wandering and the wavering feet;

O feed me, Lord, that I may feed

Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

3.  O strengthen me, that while I stand

Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee,

I may stretch out a loving hand

To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

4.  O teach me, Lord, that I may teach

The precious things Thou dost impart;

And wing my words, that they may reach

The hidden depths of many a heart.

5.  O give Thine own sweet rest to me,

That I may speak with soothing power

A word in season, as from Thee

To weary ones in needful hour.

6.  O fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,

Until my very heart o’erflow

This world affords today.

No tongue can bid me thence depart.

And tells me of the guilt within,

Upward I look, and see Him there

Who made an end of all my sin.

For God, the Just, is satisfied

To look on Him and pardon me.

Redeemed me for His own.

To keep that which I’ve committed

Unto Him against that day.”

Wrought peace within my heart.

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?

When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,

Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

We have an anchor that keeps the soul

Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,

Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,

Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love.

2.  It is safely moored, ‘twill the storm withstand,

For ’tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;

And the cables passed from His heart to mine,

Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

3.  It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,

When the breakers have told the reef is near;

Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,

Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.

When the waters cold chill our latest breath;

On the rising tide it can never fail,

While our hopes abide within the veil.

The Cross is ever nigh.

My joy still ebbs and flows,

But peace with Him remains the same,

No change my Savior knows.

5.  I change, He changes not;

The Christ can never die;

His love, not mine, the resting-place,

His truth, not mine, the tie.

Though heaven is now His home;

The mighty stone is rolled away,

But yonder is His tomb!

The grave of all my woes!

I know He died and rose.

At God’s right hand above;

I know His truth and love!

He hideth my life in the depths of His love,

And covers me there with His hand,

And covers me there with his hand.

He taketh my burden away;

He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,

Found the sheep that went astray,

Threw His loving arms around me,

Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,

Sorrow’s paths I often tread,

But the Savior still is with me;

By His hand I’m safely led.

Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,

Oh, how I praise Him! He’s coming for me.

For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;

My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;

The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design

Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;

And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,

Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.

Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?

My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me,

Life cannot be as it hath hither been.

Clear every avenue of thought and brain,

Flood my affections, purify my will,

What a price my pardon bought.

3.  More victory give me, More strength to o’ercome,

More freedom from earth-stains, More quest for the throne,

More fit for the kingdom, More useful I’d be,

More blessed and holy, More, Savior, like Thee.

1.  O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;

This is my constant longing and prayer;

Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures,

Jesus,Thy perfect likeness to wear.

O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!

Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;

Come in Thy sweetness, come inThy fullness;

StampThine own image deep on my heart.

2.  O to be like Thee! full of compassion,

Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,

Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,

Seeking the wand’ring sinners to find.

3.  O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,

Now to receive th’ anointing divine;

All that I am and have I am bringing;

Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

4.  O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,

Holy and harmless, patient and brave;

Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,

Willing to suffer, others to save.

5.  O to be like Thee! While I am pleading

Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.

Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,

Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.

# 398 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,

For my very life art Thou;

Thee I take to all my problems

As the full solution now.

Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,

In all things Thy will be done;

I but a transparent vessel

To make visible the Son.

2.  Consecrated is Thy temple,

Purged from every stain and sin;

May Thy flame of glory now be

Manifested from within.

Let the earth in solemn wonder

See my body willingly

Offered as Thy slave obedient,

Energized alone by Thee.

3.  Every moment, every member,

Girded, waiting Thy command;

Underneath the yoke to labor

Or be laid aside as planned.

When restricted in pursuing,

No disquiet will beset;

Underneath Thy faithful dealing

Not a murmur or regret.

4.  Ever tender, quiet, restful,

Inclinations put away,

That Thou may for me choose freely

As Thy finger points the way.

Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me.

For my very life art Thou;

Thee I take to all my problems

As the full solution now.

# 399 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Having seen the world’s fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

Having seen the world’s fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

(This hymn was written shortly after its author;

who had been born blind, gained her sight.)

2.  Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,

I can see in paradise,

But while here on earth His mercy

For my blindness will suffice.

3.  I no more would be delivered

From my thom, but look for grace,

While within the veil His glory

Shineth brightly on my face.

4.  In the deep dark night, His beauty

I by faith, not sight, may trace;

He was ridiculed and hated,

Yet I see His glorious face.

5.  Sun and moonlight far surpassing,

Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread,

Is the glory all transcending

Shining from His thorn-crowned head.

# 400 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.

1.  Teach me Thy way, O Lord, Teach me Thy way;

Thy gracious aid afford, Teach me Thy way.

Help me to walk aright; More by faith, less by sight;

Lead me with heav’nly light, Teach me Thy way.

2.  When doubts and fears arise, Teach me Thy way;

When storms o’erspread the skies, Teach me Thy way.

Shine thro’ the cloud and rain, Thro’ sorrow, toil, and pain;

Make Thou my pathway plain, Teach me Thy way.

3.  Long as my life shall last, Teach me Thy way;

Where’er my lot be cast, Teach me Thy way.

Until the race is run, Until the journey’s done,

Until the crown is won, Teach me Thy way.

# 401 11.11.11.11. with chorus

1.  Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,

I want Thee forever to live in my soul;

Break down ev’ry idol, cast out ev’ry foe;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;

Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

2.  Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,

Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;

To get this blest cleansing I all things forego;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

3.  Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,

And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

I give up myself and whatever I know;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

4.  Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;

By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

5.  Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;

Come now, and within me a new heart create;

To those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

# 402 8.6.8.6.

1.  Search me, O God, my actions try,

And let my life appear

As seen by thine all-searching eye—

To mine my ways make clear.

2.  Search all my sense, and know my heart\
Who only canst make known,\
And let the deep, the hidden part\
To me be fully shown.

3.  Throw light into the darkened cells,

Where passion reigns within;

Quicken my conscience till it feels

The loathsomeness of sin.

4.  Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,

The motives that control;

The chambers where polluted things

Hold empire o’er the soul.

5.  Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast

Its holy light through all,

And I by grace am brought at last

Before Thy face to fall.

6.  Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,

What now I feebly prove,

That God alone in Christ can be

Unutterable love.

# 403 8.6.8.6.

1.  Oh, for a heart to praise my God,

A heart from sin set free,

A heart that’s sprinkled with the blood

So freely shed for me.

2.  A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

My dear Redeemer’s throne;

Where only Christ is heard to speak,

Where Jesus reigns alone.

3.  A humble, lowly, contrite heart,

Believing, true, and clean,

Which neither death nor life can part

From Him that dwells within.

4.  A heart in every thought renewed,

And filled with love divine;

Perfect and right, and pure and good,

A copy, Lord, of Thine.

5.  Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart,

Come quickly frown above;

Write Thy new name upon my heart,

Thy new, best name of Love.

# 404 6.6.8.6.

1.  Bless’d are the pure in heart,

For they shall see our God;

The secret of the Lord is theirs,

Their heart is Christ’s abode.

2.  The Lord, who left the heavens,\
Our life and peace to bring,\
To dwell in lowliness with men,\
Their pattern and their King:

3.  He to the lowly soul

Doth still Himself impart,

And for His dwelling and His throne

Chooseth the pure in heart.

4.  Lord, we Thy presence seek;

May ours this blessing be;

Give us a pure and lowly heart,

A temple meet for Thee.

# 405 7.7.7.7.D.

1.  Lord, reveal Thyself to me,

That the flesh I’ll fully know;

May Thy grace so work in me,

That in dust I’ll lowly bow.

How I long for victory,

Yet, thru all my life, how weak!

Evil things I cannot leave,

Nor can do the good I seek.

2.  Inwardly I want the Lord,\
But my conduct hateful is;\
Though I would, I cannot change,\
O what real bondage ’tis!\
By God’s law my sin’s revealed,\
But the law of sin doth bind;\
Though I struggle to be free,\
No release my soul can find.

3.  Many times I fall and rise,\
Oft resolve, and often fail;\
Craving vict’ry, I retreat,\
And my sad defeat bewail.\
Truly I am sold to sin\
And completely powerless;\
There’s no good within my flesh,\
All is dark and sinfulness.

4.  Now I know myself in part,\
And confess my helplessness;\
All my temperament is odd,\
All my life corrupted is.\
Subtle self I cannot trust,\
Nor to fleshly strength can cling;\
All my trust and all my hope\
Are in Jesus Christ my King.

5.  May the Cross put me to death

That on Christ I may rely;

May His Holy Spirit fill,

That Himself I may apply.

May His death so work in me

Daily deeper than before,

That my self may be destroyed

And His life thru me may pour.

6.  O how bitter is my case!

Who this wretched slave can free,

Who deliver from this death,

To a life of victory?

Jesus shed His blood for me,

Christ is now my holiness;

I receive Him as my life

And my portion measureless.

7.  Now I’m wholly sanctified,

Selfless, I obey His word;

Nevermore to feel ashamed

When I come before the Lord.

How transcendent is this life!

Grace thru faith He gives to me!

Praise the Lord, He heard my cry

And has made me wholly free.

# 406 8.7.8.7. with chorus

1.  Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger

Of the heart that seeks Thee now;

How my soul hath long been craving

What Thou only canst bestow.

Seeking now, seeking now,

Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

1.  Failure in my walk and witness,

Failure in my work I see;

Fruitless toil, un-Christlike living,

Calling forth no praise to Thee.

1.  Now to Thee my soul confesses

All its failure, all its sin;

All the pride, the self-contentment,

All the “secret faults” within.

1.  Save me from myself, my Father,

From each subtle form of pride;

Lead me now with Christ to Calvary,

Show me I with Him have died.

1.  No more let it be my working,

Nor my wisdom, love, or power,

But the life of Jesus only,

Passing through me hour by hour.

1.  Let the fullness of Thy Spirit

Resting on Him cover me,

That the witness borne to others,

May bring glory, Lord, to Thee.

7.  Father, in Thy Son’s Name, pleading,

I believe my prayer is heard;

And I praise Thee for the answer,

Resting simply on Thy word.

# 407 10.10.10.10. with chorus

1.  Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet,

Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet;

Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,

Lower and lower; be Thou all in all.

Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,

All the world’s treasure counting but dross;

Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,

Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!

2.  Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray,

Losing the self-life still more every day;

Weak and unworthy, we’re looking above;

Empty us wholly; then fill us with love.

3.  Lower and lower; yet higher we rise,

Lifted in Christ, freed from all the earth ties;

Humbly we follow the way of the cross,

Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.

# 408 7.7.7.7.

1.  Jesus, cast a look on me;

Give me sweet simplicity;

Make me poor, and keep me low,

Seeking only Thee to know.

2.  Weaned from all my lordly self,

Weaned from all the miser’s pelf,

Weaned from all the scorner’s ways,

Weaned from all the lust of praise.

3.  All that feeds my busy pride,

Cast it evermore aside;

Bid my will to Thine submit,

Lay me humbly at Thy feet.

4.  Make me like a little child,

Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;

Seeing only in Thy light,

Walking only in Thy might;

5.  Leaning on Thy loving breast,

Where a weary soul may rest;

Feeling well the peace of God

Flowing from Thy precious blood.

6.  In this posture let me live,

And hosannas daily give;

In this temper let me die,

And hosannas ever cry.

# 409 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.  Thou hidden love of God, whose height,

hose depth unfathomed no man knows,

I see from far Thy beauteous light,

Inly I sigh for Thy repose;

My heart is pained, nor can it be

At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.

2.  Thy secret voice invites me still

The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove;

And fain I would: but though my will

Seems fixed, yet wide my passions rove;

Yet hindrances strew all the way;

I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray.

3.  ’Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought

My mind to seek her peace in Thee;

Yet, while I seek but find Thee not,

No peace my wand’ring soul shall see.

Oh, when shall all my wand’rings end,

And all my steps to Thee-ward tend!

4.  Is there a thing beneath the sun

That strives with Thee my heart to share?

Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,

The Lord of every motion there.

Then shall my heart from earth be free,

When it has found repose in Thee.

5.  Oh, hide this self from me, that I

No more, but Christ in me may live;

My vile affections mortify,

Nor let one darling sin survive.

In all things nothing may I see,

Nothing desire or seek but Thee.

6.  O Lord, Thy sovereign aid impart,

To save me from low-thoughted care;

Chase this self-will through all my heart,

Through all its latent mazes there,

Make me Thy duteous child, that I

Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry.

7.  Each moment draw from earth away

My heart which lowly waits Thy call;

Speak to my inmost soul and say,

“I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy All.”

To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice,

To taste Thy love, be all my choice.

# 410 11.10.11.10.

1.  Jesus, Redeemer and my one Inspirer,

Heat in my coldness, set my life aglow.

Break down my barriers; draw, yea, draw me nigher.

Thee would I know, whom it is life to know.

2.  Deepen me, rid me of the superficial;

From pale delusion set my spirit free;

All the entangled in me quick unravel;

Pluck forth each thread of insincerity.

3.  Thy vows are on me, oh to serve Thee truly—

Love perfectly, in purity obey—

Burn, burn, O Fire. O Wind, now winnow throughly;

O Sword, awake against the flesh and slay.

# 411 6.6.4.6.6.6.4.

1.  My faith looks up to Thee,

Thou Lamb of Calvary,

Savior Divine;

Now hear me while I pray;

Take all my guilt away;

Oh, let me from this day

Be wholly Thine.

2.  May Thy rich grace impart\
Strength to my fainting heart,\
My zeal inspire;\
As Thou hast died for me,\
Oh, may my love to Thee\
Pure, warm, and changeless be,\
A living fire.

3.  While life’s dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be Thou my Guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,

Wipe sorrow’s tears away,

Nor let me ever stray

From Thee aside.

4.  When ends life’s transient dream,

When death’s cold, sullen stream,

Shall o’er me roll;

Blest Savior, then, in love,

Fear and distrust remove;

Oh, bear me safe above,

A ransomed soul.

# 412 8.8.6.8.8.6.

1.  O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,

When shall I find my willing heart

All taken up by Thee?

My thirsty spirit faints to prove

The greatness of redeeming love,

The love of Christ to me.

2.  Stronger His love than death and hell,

Its riches are unsearchable:

The first-born sons of light

Desire in vain its depths to see;

They cannot reach the mystery,

The length, and breadth, and height.

3.  God only knows the love of God;

Oh, that it now were shed abroad

In this poor stony heart;

For love I sigh, for love I pine;

This only portion, Lord, be mine,

Be mine this better part.

4.  Oh, that I could forever sit

Like Mary, at the Master’s feet;

Be this my happy choice;

My only care, delight, and bliss,

My joy, my rest on earth be this,

To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.

# 413 7.7.7.5.

1.  Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,

Taught by You, we covet most,

Of Your gifts at Pentecost,

Holy heavenly love.

2.  Faith that mountains could remove,

Tongues of earth or heaven above,

Knowledge, all things, empty prove

Without heavenly love.

3.  Love is kind, and suffers long,

Love is meek, and thinks no wrong,

Love than death itself more strong:

Therefore give us love.

4.  Though I as a martyr bleed,

Give my goods the poor to feed,

All is vain if love I need;

Therefore give me love.

5.  Prophecy will fade away

Melting in the light of day;

Love will ever with us stay:

Therefore give us love.

6.  Faith, and hope, and love we see

Joining hand in hand, agree;

But the greatest of the three,

And the best, is love.

# 414 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.  O Lord, Thy boundless love to me

No thought can reach, no tongue declare;

Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,

And reign without a rival there;

Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;

Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.

2.  Oh, grant that nothing in my soul

May dwell but Thy pure love alone;

Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,

My joy, my treasure, and my crown;

All coldness from my heart remove;

May every act, word, thought, be love.

3.  O Love, how cheering is Thy ray,

All pain before Thy presence flies;

Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,

Where’er Thy healing beams arise;

Lord Jesus, nothing may I see,

And naught desire, or seek, but Thee.

# 415 10.10.10.10.

1.  Search me, O God, and know my heart today;

Try me, O Savior, know my thoughts, I pray.

See if there be some wicked way in me;

Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.

2.  I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin;

Fulfill Thy Word and make me pure within.

Fill me with fire where once I burned with shame;

Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.

3.  Lord, take my life and make it wholly Thine;

Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine.

Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;

I now surrender, Lord—in me abide.

4.  O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;

Send a revival—start the work in me.

Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;

For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.

# 416 9.9.10.10.6. with chorus Graham Kendrick

1.  Lord, the light of Your love is shining,

In the midst of the darkness shining;

Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us;

Set us free by the truth You now bring us,

Shine on me, shine on me.

Shine, Jesus, shine,

Fill this land with the Father’s glory;

Blaze, Spirit, blaze, Set our hearts on fire.

Flow, River, flow,Flood the nations with grace and glory;

Send forth Your Word, Lord, and let there be light.

2.  Lord, I come to Your awesome presence,

From the shadows into Your radiance;

By the blood I may enter Your brightness,

Search me, try me, consume all my darkness,

Shine on me, shine on me.

3.  As we gaze on Your kingly brightness,

So our faces display Your likeness;

Ever changing from glory to glory,

Mirror’d here may our lives tell Your story,

Shine on me, shine on me.

# 417 7.7.7.7.

1.  Prince of peace, control my will;

Bid this struggling heart be still:

Bid my fears and doubtings cease:

Hush my spirit into peace.

2.  Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,

Opened wide the gate to God;\
Peace I ask, but peace must be,\
Lord, in being one with Thee.

3.  May Thy will, not mine be done;

May Thy will and mine be one;

Chase these doubtings from my heart,

Now Thy perfect peace impart.

4.  Savior, at Thy feet I fall,

Thou, my life, my God, my all;

Let Thy happy servant be

One forevermore with Thee.

# 418 8.8.8.4.

1.  When I am in the natural man,

How very strong I feel I am,

I do not know, I cannot scan How weak I am.

2.  When in the world I have my life,

I cannot sense my failure rife,

But boasting in my earnest strife,

I forward press.

3.  When I within the darkness dwell,

My shallow state I cannot tell,

I only think how I excel,

And proudly dream.

4.  But when at last I come to Thee,

Thy searching light uncovers me,

I see what I could never see—

Myself exposed.

5.  I wither ‘neath Thy piercing ray,

And all my strength dissolves away,

My self-esteem in dust I lay,

And lowly bow.

6.  How blind and foolish is the pride

With which my soul was fortified;

From my dark heart, self-satisfied,

It issued forth.

7.  There’s not a thing that pride can claim,

There’s not a member but is lame,

There’s only deep regret and shame,

How can I pray?

8.  Thy blood from judgment saveth me,

Thy life from wrath delivers me,

How filthy yet in poverty

I really am.

9.  I want to pray, but faith have not,

I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.

Oh, canst Thou e’er renew my heart,

Have mercy, Lord!

# 419 11.10.11.10.

1.  I am the Lord’s! O joy beyond expression,

O sweet response to voice of love Divine;

Faith’s joyous “Yes” to the assuring whisper,

“Fear not! I have redeem’d thee; thou art Mine.”

2.  I am the Lord’s! It is the glad confession

Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,

When love’s “I will” accepted Him forever,

“The Lord’s,” to love, to honor and obey.

3.  I am the Lord’s! Yet teach me all it meaneth,

All it involves of love and loyalty,

Of holy service, absolute surrender,

And unreserved obedience unto Thee.

4.  I am the Lord’s! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,

O seal them irrecoverably Thine;

As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fullness

Forever and forevermore art mine.

# 420 8.6.8.6. with repeat

1.  How vast, immense, and measureless,

The love of Christ to

How else could such a wretch as I

Be blessed so wondrously?

(Repeat the last line of each stanza)

2.  To bring me back unto Himself,

My Lord His all did spend;

So I would gladly bear the cross

And follow to the end.

3.  My all I have forsaken now,

This blessed Christ to gain;

Now life or death is no concern—

What else can me restrain?

4.  My dear ones, wealth, ambition, fame—

What can they offer me?

My gracious Lord for me was poor;

For Him I poor would be.

5.  My precious Savior now I love,

His smile I would obtain.

For Him, let gain be turned to loss

And comfort turned to pain.

6.  Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord!

I’ve none in heav’n but Thee.

And who but Thee is there on earth

With whom I love to be?

7.  Though loneliness and hardships come,

My soul can rise above.

This only would I ask Thee, Lord:

Enfold me in Thy love!

8.  O gracious Lord, I now beseech,

Guide me through every stage;

Stand by and strengthen me to go

Through this dark, evil age.

9.  The world, the flesh, and Satan too,

Do tempt my soul apace;

Without Thy love and strength’ning power

I may Thy name disgrace.

10.  The time, dear Lord, is short indeed;

From earth my soul set free.

When Thou dost come, I’ll sing with joy,

Hallelujah, Lord, to Thee!

# 421 8.8.8.8.6.

1.  O Love, that wilt not let me go,

I rest my weary soul in Thee;

I give Thee back the life I owe,

That in Thine ocean depths its flow

May richer, fuller be.

2.  O Light, that followest all my way,\
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;\
My heart restores its borrowed ray,\
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day\
May brighter, fairer be.

3.  O Joy, that seekest me through pain,

I cannot close my heart to Thee;

I trace the rainbow through the rain,

And feel the promise is not vain

That morn shall tearless be.

4.  O Cross, that liftest up my head,

I dare not ask to fly from Thee;

I lay in dust life’s glory dead,

And from the ground there blossoms red

Life that shall endless be.

# 422 8.8.6.8.8.6.

1.  Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;\
My heart by mighty grace compelled\
Surrenders all to Thee;\
Against Thy terrors long I strove,\
But who can stand against Thy love?\
Love conquers even me.

2.  If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,

And light’nings flash, to blast my soul,

I still had stubborn been;

But mercy has my heart subdued,

A bleeding Savior I have viewed,

And now I hate my sin.

3.  Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,

Come, take possession of Thine own,

For Thou hast set me free;

Released from Satan’s hard command,

See all my powers waiting stand,

To be employed by Thee.

# 423 6.6.6.6.8.6.

1.  Thy Life was giv’n for me,

Thy blood, O Lord, was shed,

That I might ransomed be,

And quickened from the dead;

Thy Life was giv’n for me, for me;

What have I giv’n for Thee?

2.  Long years were spent for me

In weariness and woe,

That through eternity

Thy glory I might know;

Long years were spent for me, for me;

Have I spent one for Thee?

3.  Thy Father’s home of light,

Thy rainbow-circled throne,

Were left for earthly night,

For wanderings sad and lone;

Yea, all was left for me, for me;

Have I left aught for Thee?

4.  Thou, Lord, hast borne for me

More than my tongue can tell

Of bitterest agony,

To rescue me from hell;

Thou suff’redst all for me, for me;

What have I borne for Thee?

5.  And Thou hast brought to me

Down from Thy home above

Salvation full and free,

Thy pardon and Thy love;

Great gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;

What have I brought to Thee?

6.  Oh, let my life be given,

My years for Thee be spent;

World-fetters all be riven,

And joy with suffr’ing blent;

Thou gav’st Thyself for me, for me,

I give myself to Thee.

# 424 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?

Is not thine a captured heart?

Chief among ten thousand own Him;

Joyful choose the better part.

Captivated by His beauty,

Worthy tribute haste to bring;

Let His peerless worth constrain thee,

Crown Him now unrivaled King.

2.  Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,

Lovely things of time and sense;

Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,

Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

3.  What has stripped the seeming beauty

From the idols of the earth?

Not a sense of right or duty,

But the sight of peerless worth.

4.  Not the crushing of those idols,

With its bitter void and smart;

But the beaming of His beauty,

The unveiling of His heart.

5.  Who extinguishes their taper

Till they hail the rising sun?

Who discards the garb of winter

1.  My God, my Portion, and my Love,

My everlasting All,

I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above,

Or on this earthly ball, Or on this earthly ball.

2.  What empty things are all the skies,

And this inferior clod!

There’s nothing here deserves my joys,

There’s nothing like my God,

There’s nothing like my God.

3.  To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,

And health, and safe abode;

Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,

But they are not my God, But they are not my God.

4.  How vain a toy is glittering wealth,

If once compared to’ Thee!

Or what’s my safety, or my health,

Or all my friends to me, Or all my friends to me.

5.  Were I possessor of the earth,

And called the stars my own,

Without Thy graces and Thyself,

I were a wretch undone, I were a wretch undone.

6.  Let others stretch their arms like seas,

And grasp in all the shore;

Grant me the visits of Thy grace,

And I desire no more, And I desire no more.

1.  Eternal Light! Eternal Light!\
How pure the soul must be\
When, placed within Thy searching sight,\
It shrinks not, but with calm delight\
Can live and look on Thee.

2.  The spirits that surround Thy throne

May bear the burning bliss;

But that is surely theirs alone,

Since they have never, never known

A fallen world like this.

3.  Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere

Is dark, whose mind is dim,

Before th’Ineffable appear,

And on my natural spirit bear

The uncreated beam?

4.  There is a way for man to rise

To Thee, sublime Abode;

An Offering and a Sacrifice,

A Holy Spirit’s energies,

An Advocate with God:

5.  These, these prepare us for the sight\
Of holiness above;\
The sons of ignorance and night\
May dwell in the eternal Light,\
Through the eternal Love.

# 536 10.10.10.10.10.10.

1.  My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,

And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;

He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,

Within the holiest at home with God.

O holy place! O home divinely fair!

And we, God’s little ones, abiding there.

2.  A long, long road I traveled night and day,

And sought to find within myself some way,

Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;

Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,

And then I found Christ was the only way

That I must come to Him and in Him stay.

3.  O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!

And I, God’s little one, safe hidden there.

Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,

So make me dead to everything but Thee;

That as I rest within my home most fair,

I’ll share my God in all and everywhere.

# 537 8.6.8.6.D.

1.  My heart is resting, O my God,

I will give thanks and sing;

My heart is at the secret source

Of every precious thing.

Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,

I daily, hourly sing;

My heart is at the secret source

Of every precious thing.

2.  Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,

No hand but Thine shall fill;

The waters of the earth have failed,

And I am thirsty still.

3.  I thirst for springs of heavenly life,

And here all day they rise;

I seek the treasure of Thy love,

And close at hand it lies.

4.  A glad, new song is in my mouth,

To long-loved music set,

A song of praise for all the grace

I have not tasted yet.

5.  I have a heritage of joy

That yet I must not see;

The hand that bled to make it mine

Is keeping it for me.

6.  There is a certainty of love

That sets my heart at rest;

A calm assurance for today

That to be poor is best.

7.  A prayer reposing on His truth,

Who hath made all things mine;

That draws my captive will to Him,

And makes it one with Thine.

# 538 8.8.8.8.

1.  Thou sweet, beloved will of God,

My anchor ground, my fortress hill,

My spirit’s silent, fair abode,

In Thee I hide me and am still.

2.  O Will, that willest good alone,

Lead Thou the way, Thou guidest best;

A little child, I follow on,

And, trusting, lean upon Thy breast.

3.  God’s will doth make the bitter sweet,

And all is well when it is done;

Unless His will doth hallow it,

The glory of all joy is gone.

4.  Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,

Holds fast in its sublime embrace

My captive will, a gladsome bird,

Prisoned in such a realm of grace.

5.  Within this place of certain good

Love evermore expands her wings,

Or nestling in Thy perfect choice,

Abides content with what it brings.

6.  Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke;

It lifts, it bears my happy soul,

It giveth wings to this poor heart;

My freedom is Thy grand control.

7.  Upon God’s will I lay me down,

As child upon its mother’s breast;

No silken couch, nor softest bed,

Could ever give me such deep rest.

8.  Thy wonderful grand will, my God,

With triumph now I make it mine;

And faith shall cry a joyous Yes

To every dear command of Thine.

# 539 12.8.12.8. with chorus

1.  From my spirit within flows a fountain of life—

The Triune God flowing in me;\
God the Father’s the source, Christ the Son is the course,\
And the Spirit imparts life to me.

Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,

And my soul-life at last I lay down;

O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;

At Your coming may life be my crown.

2.  In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;

He leads me by waters of rest;

No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;

In the flow I am perfectly blessed.

3.  Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,

To live in His presence divine;

Hallelujah, I’ve heard an encouraging word:

“Abide—you’re a branch in the vine.”

Our hope for years to come,\
Our shelter from the stormy blast,\

Thy saints have dwelt secure;\
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,\
And our defence is sure.

Or earth received her frame,

From everlasting Thou art God,

To endless years the same.

4.  A thousand ages in Thy sight

Are like an evening gone;

Short as the watch that ends the night

Before the rising sun.

Bears all its sons away;

They fly forgotten, as a dream

Dies at the opening day.

Our hope for years to come,\
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,\
And our eternal home.

1.  On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,

The emblem of suffering and shame,

And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best

For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,

Till my trophies at last I lay down;

I will cling to the old rugged cross,

And exchange it some day for a crown

2.  Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,

Has a wondrous attraction for me;

For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,

To bear it to dark Calvary.

3.  In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,

A wondrous beauty I see;

For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,

To pardon and sanctify me.

It’s shame and reproach gladly bear;

Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,

Where His glory forever I’ll share.

Joys that through all time abide.

As He lives and reigns within.

But at length to faith made plain:

Christ in me the Hope of Glory,

Tell it o’er and o’er again.

Not our holiness, but Him;

O Lord! empty us and fill us,

With Thy fulness to the brim.

5.  This the balm for pain and sickness,\
Just to all our strength to die,\

All our being’s need supply.

To the world and self and sin;

To the death-born life of Jesus

I am sweetly ent’ring in:

In His fellowship of suff’ring,

To His death conformed to be,

I am going with my Savior

All the way to Calvary.

All the way to Calvary,

Where my Savior went for me,

Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,

All the way to Calvary.

When His risen life we know;

’Tis not hard to share His suff’rings

When our hearts with joy o’erflow.

In His resurrection power

He has come to dwell in me,

And my heart is gladly going

All the way to Calvary.

If we suffer we shall reign;

All the way to Calvary.”

1.  Though Christ a thousand times

In Bethlehem be born,

If He’s not born in thee

Thy soul is still forlorn.

The Cross on Golgotha,

Will never save thy soul;

The Cross in thine own heart,

Alone can make thee whole.

O, Cross of Christ, I take thee

Into this heart of mine,

That I to my own self may die

And rise to thy life Divine.

2.  What e’er thou lovest, man,

That too become thou must;

God, if thou lovest God,

Dust, if thou lovest dust.

Go out, God will come in;

Die thou and let Him live;

Be not and He will be;

Wait and He’ll all things give.

3.  To bring thee to thy God,

Love takes the shortest route;

The way which knowledge leads,

Is but a roundabout.

Drive out from thee the world,

And then thy heart shall be

Filled with the love of God,

And holy like as He.

1.  First the blood, and then the ointment,

Cleansing, then anointing comes;

If we pass not thru Golgotha,

Ne’er to Pentecost we’ll come.

If the blood has never cleansed us,

Ne’er the Spirit’s pow’r we’ll know,

If for Christ we’d truly witness,

Self-life to the Cross must go.

Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,

Put my soul-life all away;

Make me any price to pay,

Full anointing to receive.

2.  Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten,\
That the living water flow;\
Without death the Spirit’s fulness\
Ne’er could dwell in man below.\
If with Christ we die completely,\
Willing thus our all to lose,\
He will clothe us with His power\
And to win the world will use.

3.  First the altar, then the fire,

If no loss, there’ll be no gain;

If our all has not been offered,

To the throne we’ll ne’er attain.

If to sacrifice we’re willing,

All forsaking, God t’obey,

He to us will be committed

And thru us His pow’r display.

4.  First we must prepare the vessels

That the Oil they may contain;

Dig the valley full of ditches

That they may be filled with Rain.

First we must go thru the Jordan

Ere anointed from above;

First in death we must be baptized,

Then experience the Dove.

5.  When we see the ripened harvest

Of the golden countryside,

We may know that many seeds have

Fallen to the earth and died.

Ere the fruit of life may blossom,

We must surely suffer death;

If with Christ we’ve not been buried,

We’ll not feel the Spirit’s breath.

6.  Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,

Help me go the narrow way;

Deal with pride and make me willing

Thus to suffer, Thee t’obey.

I for greater power pray not.

Deeper death is what I need;

All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,

Work in my—for this I plead.

# 549 Irregular Meter

1.  The way of the Cross means sacrifice,

As to God you yield your all

To be laid on the altar, the place of death,

Where fire will surely fall.

’Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?

What does bearing the Cross mean to you?

You who’ve given yourself, your all to God!

To God are you wholly true?

2.  As the voice of song and prayer we raise,

How easy to say, We give all;\
Till some rougher cross lies just before,\
And sterner is duty’s call.

3.  Do you falter then, or, true to death,

Just die on the cross in the way,

Till the fulness of life from the Living One

Is filling you day by day?

4.  ’Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,\
One with Jesus crucified;\
With the life alone to be lived through you,\
Of the Risen, the Glorified.

# 550 6.5.6.5.D.

1.  If the path I travel

Lead me to the cross,

If the way Thou choosest

Lead to pain and loss,

Let the compensation

Daily, hourly, be

Shadowless communion,

Blessed Lord, with Thee.

2.  If there’s less of earth joy,

Give, Lord, more of heaven.

Let the spirit praise Thee,

Though the heart be riven;

If sweet earthly ties, Lord,

Break at Thy decree,

Let the tie that binds us,

Closer, sweeter, be.

3.  Lonely though the pathway,

Cheer it With Thy smile;

Be Thou my companion

Through earth’s little while;

Selfless may I live, Lord,

By Thy grace to be

Just a cleansed channel

For Thy life through me.

# 551 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Via Bethlehem we journey,

We whose hearts on God are set;

Babelike souls of Jesus learning,

While our cheeks with tears are wet;

For the manger and the stable

Are not pleasant to our eyes,

But our feet must follow Jesus,

If our hands would grasp the prize.

2.  Via Nazareth! the pathway

Narrows still as on we go,

Years of toil none understanding,

Yet God teaches us to know

That the servant is not greater

Than the Lord, who thro’ long years

Hid Himself from this world’s glory,

Follow Him! Count not the tears.

3.  Via Galilee, we see Him!

Stones are hurled, and curses hissed

By the men who gather round Him,

Has He not the pathway missed?

No! unharmed the Savior passes,

And this rough bit of the way

We must travel, since like Jesus,

Nothing can our purpose stay.

4.  Via too, the awful anguish

Of the hours beneath the trees,

Where the hosts of Satan linger,

Awful hours of anguish these!

Yet we fail not, for God’s angels

Minister to us, and say,

“Look, beloved, at the glory,

Conflict is but for a day!”

5.  Then the Cross! for via Calvary

Every royal soul must go;

Here we draw the veil, for Jesus

Only can the pathway show;

“If we suffer with Him,” listen,

Just a little, little While,

And the memory will have faded

In the glory of His smile!

6.  Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,\
Knowing that all life has fled;\
(Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered\
With the men the world calls dead?)\
Thence we rise, and live with Jesus,\
Throned above the world’s mad strife,\
Gladly forfeiting forever,\
All that worldlings count as life.

7.  On we press! and yonder gleaming,\
Nearing every day, we see\
The great walls of that fair city,

God has built for such as we;

And we catch the tender music

Of the choirs that sing of One

Who once died to have us with Him

In His kingdom, on the throne.

8.  Just a few more miles, beloved!

And our feet shall ache no more;

No more sin, and no more sorrow,

Hush thee, Jesus went before;

And I hear Him sweetly whispering,

“Faint not, fear not, still press on,

For it may be ere tomorrow,

The long journey will be done.”

# 552 4.10.8.8.6.

1.  Hast thou no scar?

No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand?

I hear thee sung throughout the land,

I hear them hail thy shining star,

Hast thou no scar? no scar?

2.  Hast thou no wound?

Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,

Leaned Me against a tree; and rent

By ravening beasts ‘round Me, I swooned:

Hast thou no wound? no wound?

3.  No wound? no scar?

Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,

And pierced the feet that follow Me;

But whole? can he have followed far

Who has no wound nor scar?

1.  Olives that have known no pressure

No oil can bestow;

If the grapes escape the winepress,

Cheering wine can never flow;

Spikenard only through the crushing,

Fragrance can diffuse.

Shall I then, Lord, shrink from suff’ring

Which Thy love for me would choose?

Each blow I suffer

Is true gain to me.

In the place of what Thou takest

Thou dost give Thyself to me.

2.  Do my heart-strings need Thy stretching,

Songs divine to prove?

Do I need for sweetest music

Cruel treatment of Thy love?

Lord, I fear no deprivation

If it draws to Thee;

I would yield in full surrender

All Thy heart of love to see.

3.  I’m ashamed, my Lord, for seeking.

Self to guard alway;

Though Thy love has done its stripping,

Yet I’ve been compelled this way.

Lord, according to Thy pleasure

Fully work on me;

Heeding not my human feelings,

Only do what pleases Thee.

4.  If Thy mind and mine should differ,

Still pursue Thy way;

If Thy pleasure means my sorrow,

Still my heart shall answer. “Yea!”

’Tis my deep desire to please Thee,

Though I suffer loss;

E’en though Thy delight and glory

Mean that I endure the cross.

5.  Oh, I’ll praise Thee, e’en if weeping

Mingle with my song.

Thine increasing sweetness calls forth

Grateful praises all day long.

Thou hast made Thyself more precious

Than all else to me:

Thou increase and I decrease, Lord—

This is now my only plea.

# 554 7.7.7.7.

1.  ’Tis my happiness below

Not to live without the cross;

But the Savior’s pow’r to know

Sanctifying every loss.

2.  Trials must and will befall;

But with humble faith to see

Love inscribed upon them all—

This is happiness to me.

3.  Did I meet no trials here,

No chastisement by the way,

Might I not with reason fear

I should prove a castaway?

4.  Trials make the promise sweet;

Trials give new life to prayer;

Bring me to my Savior’s feet,

Lay me low and keep me there.

# 555 8.7.8.7.D.

1.  Let us contemplate the grape vine,\
From its life now let us learn,\
How its growth is fraught with suff’ring,\
Midst environment so stern;\
How unlike the untamed flowers\
Growing in the wilderness\
In a maze of wild confusion,\
Making patterns numberless.

2.  But the blossoms of the grape vine

Without glory are and small;\
Though they do have some expression,\
They are hardly seen withal.\
But a day since they have flowered\
Into fruit the blooms have grown;\
Never may they wave corollas\
With luxuriant beauty shown.

3.  To a post the vine is fastened;

Thus it cannot freely grow;

When its branches are extended,

To the trellis tied they go.

To the stony soil committed,

Drawing thence its food supply;

It can never choose its own way,

Or from difficulty fly.

4.  Oh, how beautiful its verdure,

Which in spring spreads o’er the field.

From life’s energy and fulness

Growth abundant doth it yield.

Till it’s full of tender branches

Twining freely everywhere,

Stretching ‘gainst the sky’s deep azure

Tasting sweetly of the air.

5.  But the master of the vineyard

Not in lenience doth abide,

But with knife and pruning scissors

Then would strip it of its pride.

Caring not the vine is tender,

But with deep, precision stroke

All the pretty, excess branches

From the vine are neatly broke.

6.  In this time of loss and ruin,

Dare the vine self-pity show?

Nay, it gives itself more fully

To the one who wounds it so,

To the hand that strips its branches,

Till of beauty destitute,

That its life may not be wasted,

But preserved for bearing fruit.

7.  Into hard wood slowly hardens

Every stump of bleeding shoot,

Each remaining branch becoming

Clusters of abundant fruit.

Then, beneath the scorching sunshine,

Leaves are dried and from it drop;

Thus the fruit more richly ripens

Till the harvest of the crop,

8.  Bowed beneath its fruitful burden,

Loaded branches are brought low—

Labor of its growth thru suff’ring

Many a purposed, cutting blow.

Now its fruit is fully ripened,

Comforted the vine would be;

But the harvest soon is coming,

And its days of comfort flee.

9.  Hands will pick and feet will trample

All the riches of the vine,

Till from out the reddened wine-press

Flows a river full of wine.

All the day its flow continues,

Bloody-red, without alloy,

Gushing freely, richly, sweetly,

Filling all the earth with joy.

10.  In appearance now the grape vine

Barren is and pitiful;

Having given all, it enters

Into night inscrutable.

No one offers to repay it

For the cheering wine that’s drunk,

But ’tis stripped and cut e’en further

To a bare and branchless trunk.

11.  Yet its wine throughout the winter

Warmth and sweetness ever bears

Unto those in coldness shiv’ring,

Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.

Yet without, alone, the grape vine

Midst the ice and snow doth stand,

Steadfastly its lot enduring,

Though, tis hard to understand.

12.  Winter o’er, the vine prepareth

Fruit again itself to bear;

Budding forth and growing branches,

Beauteous green again to wear;

Never murmuring or complaining

For the winter’s sore abuse,

Or for all its loss desiring

Its fresh off’ring to reduce.

13.  Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,

As it lifts its arms on high,

Earth’s impure, defiled affections

Ne’er the vine may occupy.

Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,

And while love doth prune once more,

Strokes it bears as if it never

Suffered loss and pain before.

14.  From the branches of the grape vine

Sap and blood and wine doth flow.

Does the vine, for all it suffered,

Lost, and yielded, poorer grow?

Drunkards of the earth and wanderers,

From it drink and merry make.

From their pleasure and enjoyment

Do they richer thereby wake?

15.  Not by gain our life is measured,

But by what we’ve lost ’tis scored;

’Tis not how much wine is drunken,

But how much has been outpoured.

For the strength of love e’er standeth

In the sacrifice we bear;

He who has the greatest suff’ring

Ever has the most to share.

16.  He who treats himself severely

Is the best for God to gain;

He who hurts himself most dearly

Most can comfort those in pain.

He who suffering never beareth

Is but empty “sounding brass”;

He who self-life never spareth

Has the joys which all surpass.

# 556 8.6.8.6.

1.  If from the right course I depart,

Then ease my lot would be;

But I remember how my Lord

Did suffer agony.

2.  I’ll utterly forsake this world,

And sever all its ties.

My path may narrow more and more;

And all against me rise.

3.  Though men may scowl and laugh to scorn,

I only want His smile.

His “well done” only I’d secure

While here this little while.

4.  Not after greatness do I seek,

Nor glory here desire,

But humbly I would serve the Lord,

His praise that day acquire.

5.  I’m daily gazing at the light

Shed from His judgment seat,

That all my living and my work

The test of fire may meet.

6.  Let others seek for great success,

For glory, wealth, and name;

Let them procure their grandeur here,

Their followers and fame.

7.  In solitude and poverty,

Though prospering not in soul,

Yet faithfully I’ll follow Him

Until I reach the goal.

8.  I know that when on earth He dwelt

His lot was but the cross;

And that is why I only wish

With Him to suffer loss.

9.  Since all my glories lie ahead,

I must to patience cleave.

1.  Beneath the cross of Jesus

I fain would take my stand,

The shadow of a mighty Rock

Within a weary land;

A home within the wilderness,

A rest upon the way,

From the burning of the noontide heat,

And the burden of the day.

2.  Oh, safe and happy shelter!

Oh, refuge tried and sweet!

Oh, trysting place where heaven’s love

And heaven’s justice meet.

As to the holy patriarch

That wondrous dream was given,

So is my Savior by the cross

A ladder up to heaven.

3.  There lies beneath its shadow,

But on the farther side,

The darkness of an awful grave

That gapes both deep and wide;

And there between us stands the cross,

Two arms outstretched to save,

Like a watchman set to guard the way

From that eternal grave.

4.  Upon that cross of Jesus

Mine eye at times can see

The very dying form of One,

Who suffered there for me;

And from my smitten heart, with tears,

Two wonders I confess,

The wonders of His glorious love,

And my own worthlessness.

5.  I take, O cross, thy shadow

For my abiding place;

I ask no other sunshine than

The sunshine of His face;

Content’ to let the world go by,

To know no gain nor loss,

My sinful self my only shame,

My glory all the cross.

Flows from Calv’ry’s mountain.

Be my glory ever;

Till my raptured soul shall find

Rest with Him forever.

2.  Near the cross, a trembling soul,

Love and mercy found me;

There the Bright and Morning Star

Sheds its beams around me.

3.  Near the cross! O Lamb of God,

Bring its scenes before me;

Help me walk from day to day,

With its shadow o’er me.

4.  Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,

Hoping, trusting ever,

Till I see my Savior’s face,

Leave His presence never.

Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;\
Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,\
”Not I, but Christ” in me from hour to hour.

Trodden by those who glory in the Cross.

They live in fellowship with “Jesus only,”

And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.

It saves me now, and shall for ever save;

It holds me up in days of helplessness,

It bears me safely o’er each swelling wave.

That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;

Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;

Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.

1.  I’ll sing of the wonderful promise

That Jesus has given to me;

“My strength is made perfect in weakness,

My grace is sufficient for thee.”

And lest my poor heart should forget it,

Or ever forgetful should be,

He still keeps repeating the promise,

My grace is sufficient for thee.

Yes, over and over and over,

My Savior keeps saying to me;

My strength is made perfect in weakness,

My grace is sufficient for thee.

2.  His grace is sufficient to save me,

And cleanse me from guilt and from sin;\
Sufficient to sanctify wholly,\
And give me His Spirit within.\
His grace is sufficient for trials,\
No matter how hard they may be,\
This promise stands over against them,\
My grace is sufficient for thee.

3.  His grace is sufficient for sickness,

Sustaining and making me whole;

His grace is sufficient when sorrows

Like billows roll over the soul.

His grace is sufficient for service,

It sets us from selfishness free,

And sends us to tell to the tried ones,\
His grace is sufficient for thee.

4.  His grace is sufficient to live by,

And should we be summoned to die

‘Twill light up the valley of shadows,

And bear us away to Him nigh.

Or when we shall stand in His vict’ry,\
And Christ in His glory shall see,\
We’ll fall at His footstool confessing,\
Thy grace was sufficient for me.

5.  I t is not our grace that’s sufficient,\
But His grace, it ever must be:\
Our graces are transient and changing;\
His grace is unfailing as He.\
And so I am ever repeating\
His wonderful promise to me,\
My strength is made perfect in weakness,\
My grace is sufficient for thee.

# 589 9.9.9.9.D.

1.  God hath not promised skies always blue,

Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;\
God hath not promised sun without rain,\
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.

But God hath promised strength for the day,

Rest for the labor, light for the way,

Grace for the trials, help from above,

Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

2.  God hath not promised we shall not know

Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;

He hath not told us we shall not bear

Many a burden, many a care.

3.  God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,

Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;

Never a mountain, rocky and steep,

Never a river, turbid and deep.

1.  The cross that He gave may be heavy,

But it ne’er outweighs His grace;\

The cross is not greater than His grace,\
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;\
I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below,\
I can conquer every foe.

Than composed His crown for me;\
The cup that I drink not more bitter\
Than He drank in Gethsemane.

As it falls on paths of woe;

The toil of my work groweth lighter,

As I stoop to raise the low.

As I’m walking in His sight;

My trials more blessings are bringing,

Christ in them is my delight.

1.  He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,\
He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,\
To added affliction He addeth His mercy,\
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.

2.  When we have exhausted our store of endurance,\
When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,\
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,\
Our Father’s full giving is only begun.

3.  His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,\
His power no boundary known unto men,\
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,\
He giveth and giveth and giveth again.

1.  A little bird I am,\
Shut from the fields of air,\
And in my cage I sit and sing\
To Him who placed me there;\
Well pleased a prisoner to be,\
Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.

2.  Nought have I else to do,\
I sing the whole day long;\
And He whom most I love to please\
Doth listen to my song;\
He caught and bound my wandering wing;\
But still He bends to hear me sing.

3.  Thou hast an ear to hear\
A heart to love and bless;\
And though my notes were e’er so rude,\
Thou wouldst not hear the less;\
Because Thou knowest as they fall,\
That love, sweet love, inspires them all.

4.  My cage confines me round;\
Abroad I cannot fly;\
But though my wing is closely bound,\
My heart’s at liberty;\
For prison walls cannot control\
The flight, the freedom of the soul.

These bolts and bars above!\
To Him whose purpose I adore,\
Whose providence I love;\
And in Thy mighty will to find\
The joy, the freedom of the mind.

’Tis hard to be alone;\
But know not One can bless me,\
Who comes through bars and stone;\
He makes my dungeon’s darkness bright,\
And fills my bosom with delight.

3.  Thy love, O God, restores me

From sighs and tears to praise;

And deep my soul adores Thee,

Nor thinks of time or place:

I ask no more, in good or ill,

But union with Thy holy will.

’Tis that which brings my gain;

Converting woe to pleasure,

And reaping joy from pain.

Oh, ’tis enough, whate’er befall,

To know that God is All in all.

# 594 10.10.10.10. with chorus

1.  Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;

Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul,

Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.

God is my hope and God is my joy;

Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;

Pressed into knowing none to help but God,

Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord,

Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.

1.  His angels His countenance always behold,

But never experience His grace;

His saints, while they know His unlimited love,

Have never yet looked on His face.

Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold,

The sight of His glory will gain;

But Mary, beholding His tear-be-dimmed eyes,

Could see His heart’s anguish and pain,

Could see His heart’s anguish and pain.

2.  We soon will see Jesus, our Lord, face to face,

We’ll know Him as never before;

But then there’s no need for a hand such as His

To heal a heart broken and sore.

In heaven we’ll offer Him praise without end—

No praying or tears needed there,

Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend,

Or place for importunate prayer,

Or place for importunate prayer.

3.  In heavenly glory, that day we’ll be crowned

And nevermore carry a cross.

’Tis only on earth where our Lord was disowned

We share His rejection and loss.

When entering rest in that morning so fair,

Our anguish and trials will end;

His sorrow and shame we’ll no more with Him share,

Or sacrifice pleasures for Him,

Or sacrifice pleasures for Him.

4.  Alas, we are left with few chances to share,

To learn and to taste of His grief.

Yet still for His sake His reproach we may bear—

Such times we can never retrieve.

Reviling and scorn shall we still here bemoan

When soon they no longer will be?

I treasure these temporal blessings I’ve known,

For thus, Lord, I’m made one with Thee,

For thus, Lord, I’m made one with Thee.

5.  I long, Lord, to gaze on Thy wonderful face­

’Tis better by far Thee to meet.

But now I would choose Thy dear suffering grace

And not miss such fellowship sweet.

Have mercy on me; fill me, Lord, with Thy love

To live for Thee here at all cost,

Lest earnestly seeking a heaven above

I then regret chances were lost,

I then regret chances were lost.

The throne of grace I dare address,

For Jesus is my righteousness.

7.  Though faint my prayers and cold my love,

My steadfast hope shall not remove,

While Jesus intercedes above.

But on my side is power divine;

Warm as summer sunshine, Sweet as morning dew;

Why should you be fearful, Why take anxious thought,

Since the mind of Jesus Cares for those He bought?

3.  In the field of Jesus There is work for you;

Such as even angels Might rejoice to do;

Why stand idly sighing For some life-work grand,

While the field of Jesus Seeks your reaping hand?

Glorious, bright, and joyous, Right and peaceful too;

In the light of His glory and grace.

My eyes are on Him, and He shows me the way;

Its trembling is still when I see Jesus near;

Of Jesus my Lord when I stand face to face;

Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;

How can I take my harp down from the willow?

How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?

Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer—

Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,

But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?

Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;

Thy coming bids me seek a better country,

Since Thou art gone the sense of void o’erwhelms me.

Yet in my heart there’s still a sense of lack.

Enlightening and tenderest sustaining

When I feel most content, the silent yearning

To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.

And long his people once again to greet?

What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?

Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,

What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?

Soon to return and take me unto Thee?

Yet day by day and year by year I’ve waited

And still I wait, and no return I see!

While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.

How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer

Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?

Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen

Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.

How long, how very long the time has been!

Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further

Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?

For Thy return—yet, Lord, not I alone,

But Thy dear saints through many generations—

Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.

To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,

By Thine appearing haste to make reply.

Come, come and answer now this mighty corp’rate cry!

The child who trusts Thy Name.

Into Thy bosom giv’n.

Not one soul with which to greet Him:

For my Savior saves me now;

But to meet Him empty-handed,

Thought of that now clouds my brow.

3.  So nigh, so very nigh to God,

I cannot nearer be;

For in the person of His Son

I am as near as He.

4.  So dear, so very dear to God,

More dear I cannot be;

The love wherewith He loves the Son,

Such is His love to me.

5.  Why should I ever anxious be,

Since such a God is mine?

He watches o'er me night and day,

And tells me ""Mine is thine.""

1.  Wonderful grand new song of the Lamb;

Glory to God! Glory to God!

Marvelous news bringing joy to men;

Glory to God on high!

Jesus my Lord came down to earth,

Leaving His glory us to save,

Such wondrous grace beyond compare,

For sinners as I He cares.

Shout of His praise, let the heart resound,

Glory to God! Glory to God!

Never the world knew such matchless song!

Glory to God on high!

2.  Hark to the rhymes of the heav’nly song;

Glory to God! Glory to God!

Jesus is love, and He is light;

Glory to God on high!

All guilty sinners born to die

Who hopelessly in darkness cry,

Help from the Lord won’t be denied—

O come and be justified!

3.  Lift up your voice for the judgement’s past;

Glory to God! Glory to God!

Risen with Christ, we with Him are one;

Glory to God on high!

O death and sin, where is thy sting?

On yonder shore we stand and sing!

See how the Red Sea drowns our foes—

Salvation to us is told!

4.  Sing, for He’s coming to take the saints;

Glory to god! Glory to God!

He tarries not, for the Church’s full grown;

Glory to God on high!

All yearning hearts are satisfied;

Whispers of love we’ll ever breathe,

One future with Him we share!

Glory to God! Glory to God!

Ring out this theme, sing forevermore;

Glory to God on high!

Sing, till the whole world hear our voice;

Sing, till all heav’n and earth rejoice—

All new creatures,

lift your voice!

1.  Come, ye that love the Lord,

And let your joys be known,

Join in a song with sweet accord,

And thus surround the throne.

Rejoice! His grace is free!

Rejoice! His grace is free!

Full pardon granted, grace is free!,

Rejoice! His grace is free.

2.  Let those refuse to sing

Who never knew our God;

But children of the heav'nly King,

Must speak their joys abroad.

3.  The hill of Zion yields

A thousand sacred sweets,

Before we reach the heav'nly fields,

Or walk the golden streets.

And every tear be dry;

We're marching through Immanuel's ground,

To fairer worlds on high.

More of Thyself I need.

To Thee I now surrender,

“More of Thyself!” I plead.

Give me Thyself, I pray.

Still give Thyself, I pray.

If Thy return will be delayed,

I need Thyself today.

1.  Father, I know that all my life

Is portioned out for me;

The changes that are sure to come

I do not fear to see;

I ask Thee for a present mink,

Intent on pleasing Thee.

2.  I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,

Through constant watching

To meet the glad with joyful

To wipe the weeping eyes,

A heart at leisure from itself,

To soothe and sympathize.

3.  I would not have the restless will

That hurries to and fro,

Seeking for some great thing to do,

Or secret thing to know;

I would be treated as a child,

And guided where I go.

4.  Wherever in the world I am,

In what-soe'er estate,

I have a fellowship with hearts

To keep and cultivate;

A work of lowly love to do

For Him on whom I wait.

5.  I ask Thee for the daily strength,

To none that ask denied,

A mind to blend with outward life,

While keeping at Thy side;

Content to fill a little space,

If Thou be glorified.

6.  On every path there is untruth,

That I might patient be;

In every way there is a cross,

That I might lean on Thee.

A lowly heart will find each place

A paradise for me.

7.  And if some things I ask not in

My cup of blessing be,

I'd have my spirit filled the more

With grateful love to Thee;

More careful—not to serve Thee much,

But please Thee perfectly.

8.  In service which Thy will appoints,

There are no bonds for me;

My inmost heart is taught the truth

That makes Thy children free;

A life of self-renouncing love

Is one of liberty.

# 801 7.7.7.7.

1.  Jesus, cast a look on me;

Give me sweet simplicity;

Make me poor, and keep me low,

Seeking only Thee to know.

2.  Weaned from all my lordly self,

Weaned from all the miser's pelf,

Weaned from all the scorner's ways,

Weaned from all the lust of praise.

3.  All that feeds my busy pride,

Cast it evermore aside;

Bid my will to Thine submit,

Lay me humbly at Thy feet.

4.  Make me like a little child,

Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;

Seeing only in Thy light,

Walking only in Thy might;

5.  Leaning on Thy loving breast,

Where a weary soul may rest;

Feeling well the peace of God

Flowing from Thy precious blood.

6.  In this posture let me live,

And hosannas daily give;

In this temper let me die,

And hosannas ever cry.

1.  Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?

Is not thine a captured heart?

Chief among ten thousand own Him;

Joyful choose the better part.

Captivated by His beauty,

Worthy tribute haste to bring;

Let His peerless worth constrain thee,

Crown Him now unrivaled King.

2.  Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,

Lovely things of time and sense;

Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,

Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

3.  What has stripped the seeming beauty

From the idols of the earth?

Not a sense of right or duty,

But the sight of peerless worth.

4.  Not the crushing of those idols,

With its bitter void and smart;

But the beaming of His beauty,

The unveiling of His heart.

5.  Who extinguishes their taper

Till they hail the rising sun?

Who discards the garb of winter

Till the summer has begun?

6.  ’Tis that look that melted Peter,

’Tis that face that Stephen saw,

’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,

Can alone from idols draw:

7.  Draw and win and fill completely,\
Till the cup o’erflow the brim;\
What have we to do with idols\
Who have companied with Him?

And grieve Thy Spirit all the day

While Thou dost wait for me?

And wait no longer, for I yearn

Henceforth to follow Thee.

2.  I offer now without reserve

All that I am and all I have

Thy purpose to fulfill.

Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,

That henceforth I may only seek

To do the Father's will.

3.  When I look back, what grief and shame

That I've brought none to trust Thy name,

Thy word I've locked within.

Oh, may the Lord anointing give

And richly through my being live,

That I may speak of Him.

4.  My gracious Lord has giv'n much grace,

Exceeding e'en a friend my place;

I fain would be His bride.

I'd share His life and suffer loss,

Accepting willingly the cross,

With Him identified.

Lord, here I take my cross now to follow Thee,

Worldly gain, empty fame are but dross to me.

Men may sneer, men may jeer, pain may come or stay;

Naught can cause me to stray from the narrow way.

Thro’ His word, by His grace, I would faithful be;

Till at last I reach home, there’s a crown for me,

A bright crown for me, yes, a crown for me.

# 806 6.6.6.6.

1.  He is most dear to me,

The loveliest of all;

On whom I ever call.

2.  He is my aid, in need,

My help, in helpless hours;

Most precious at all times,

Most faithful at all hours.

3.  He is my endless joy,

Changeless as years go by;

He is most dear to me,

No greater love have I.

# 807 8.7.8.7.D.

He is your heart's very need;

What else can you desire or seek?

All things are empty indeed!

He is so rich, He is so full,

He can fulfill all your needs!

He is so good, He is so sweet,

All your desire He exceeds!

2.  Give up the world, Christ to obtain,

He is the One you require;

Once you receive this glorious Christ,

Never the rest you'll desire.

3.  Though very great is all the world,

And very small is your heart,

Yet the great world with all its wealth

Never can fill your small heart.

4.  If you have Christ, you have all joys;

Without this Christ, only pains;

Where there is Christ there morning is;

Where He is not, night remains.

Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;

Beauteous as henna, I'd be clothed with Him;

Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;

His love the banner, His affection shown

Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

4.  Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;

I am a lily and my Shepherd He;

May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,

The resurrection, permeate my heart;

North wind awake, and let the south wind blow,

Make my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.

Be my last thought how sweet to rest

Forever on my Savior's breast.

For without Thee I cannot live;

Abide with me when night is nigh,

For without Thee I dare not die.

Till in the ocean of Thy love

We lose ourselves in Thee above.

Though His blood-marked steps may lead me

To the garden, to the tomb.

But the time will not be long

Till the night shall change to morning,

And the sorrow into song.

While He turns our grief to gladness,

And our darkness into light.

And sickens it of passing shows

To shun th' eternal fires;

Though rough and straight the road;

Yet nothing less can satisfy

The love that longs for God.

4.  Oh, utter but the Name of God

Down in your heart of hearts,

And see how from the world at once

All tempting light departs.

Can win their way above;

If mountains can be moved by faith,

Is there less power in love?

How little hast thou gone!

Take heart, and let the thought of God

Allure thee further on.

How swiftly wouldst thou move!

No inward token miss:

And go where grace entices thee—

Perfection lies in this.

3.  He'll enlighten your darkened heart with light,

Forgive your sins and rescue you with might;

He will cleanse you from all stains with His blood,

And give to you the life of God, So you need Jesus!

4.  In your living there is a lack you sense,

And thru the years it grows the more intense;

Only Jesus this need can satisfy;

All vanity He will defy, So you need Jesus!

You need Jesus! You need Jesus!

Men and women all need Him!

To escape from vanity,

To obtain reality,

To make life significant,

Yes, you need Jesus!

5.  All this world now is rife with toil and pain,

> In troubled times there's nothing to sustain;
>
> All is empty, on what can you rely?
>
> All things reveal and testify

That you need Jesus!

1.  There were ninety and nine that safely lay

In the shelter of the flock,

But one was out on the hills away,

Far off in the cold and dark;

Away on the mountains wild and bare,

Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

2.  “Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;

Are they not enough for Thee?”

But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine

Has wandered away from Me;

And although the road be rough and steep,

I go to the desert to find My sheep.”

3.  But none of the ransomed ever knew

How deep were the waters crossed;

Nor how dark was the night

which the Lord passed through

Ere He found His sheep that was lost.

Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry—

All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.

4.  “Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way

That mark out the mountain’s track?”

“They were shed for one who had gone astray

Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”

“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?”

“They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.”

5.  And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,

And up from the rocky steep,

There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,

“Rejoice! I have found My sheep!”

And the angels echoed around the throne,

“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!”

1.  I hear my risen Savior say:

“Follow me, follow me, follow me”;

His voice is calling all the day,

“Follow me, follow me, follow me.

For thee I trod the bitter way,

For thee I gave my life away,

And drank the gall thy debt to pay,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.”

2.  ""Tho' thou hast sinn'd, I'll pardon thee,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

From ev'ry sin I'll set thee free,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

In all thy changing life I'll be

Thy God, thy guide on land and sea,

Thy bliss thro' all eternity,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.""

3.  ""Bring unto me thy many cares,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

Thy heavy load my arm upbears,

Follow me, follow me, follow me;

Lean on my breast, dismiss thy fears,

And trust me thro' thy future years,

My hand shall wipe away all tears,

Follow me, follow me, follow me.""

1.  Jesus lingers still: ‘tis for you He waits,

And He’s waiting for you long;

He waits that heaven, with its fadeless joys,

May yet to you belong.

Come, and welcome, whosoever will,

‘Tis the Savior’s gracious call;

He is able, willing , waiting now to save,

Simply trust Him, that is all.

2.  Though your wayward feet may have wandered far,

And you're deeply sunk in sin;

Yet the Savior waits, with His patient grace

Your stony heart to win.

3.  Though His gracious call you have oft refused

And He's sought your trust in vain;

Yet, with love unchanged by your cold neglect

He is seeking you again.

4.  Oh, surrender now! yield to love divine;

Jesus lingers for you still:

While in grace He says, ""Oh, come to Me,""

Let your answer be, ""I will.""

1.  Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,

Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;

Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

Bringing in the sheaves, brining in the sheaves,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;

Bringing in the sheaves, brining in the sheaves,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

2.  Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,

Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;

By and by, the harvest and the labor ended,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

3.  Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,

Tho' the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;

When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

1.  I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,

A dear, loving Savior, tho’ earth-friends be few;

And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,

But O, that my Savior were your Savior too!

For you I am praying,

For you I am praying,

I’m praying for you.

2.  I have a Father; to me He has given

A hope for eternity, blessed and true;

And soon He will call me to meet Him in Heaven,

But O, that He'd let me bring you with me too!

3.  I have a joy, rolling as the sea billows,

Since Jesus my Savior took my sins away;

And now He lives in me-what joy divine o'erflows!

But O, that He'd give you this same joy today.

4.  I have a peace; it is calm as a river,

A peace that the friends of this world never knew;

My Savior alone is its author and giver,

And O, could I know it was given for you!

5.  When He has found you, tell others the story,

That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;

Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory,

And prayer will be answered—'twas answered for you!
